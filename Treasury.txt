BUDGET FRAMEWORK
• Investing in strategic infrastructure, supporting job creation and maintaining a growth-friendly fiscal policy will underpin government
policy over the medium term.
• The fiscal strategy remains on course. It blends critical spending measures, including for essential services and infrastructure investments,
with revenue increases.
• The consolidated budget deficit is expected to narrow from 5 per cent of GDP in 2024/25 to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2027/28.
• Government will reach the important milestone to stabilise debt next year through the strengthening primary surplus.
• Debt-service costs, which consume 22 cents of every rand of revenue, will stabilise in the current year.
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
• Real economic growth is forecast to increase to 1.9 per cent in 2025.
• Lower-than-expected growth in 2024 is due to unanticipated weaknesses in agriculture and transport during the third quarter.
• Economic growth is projected to average 1.8 per cent from 2025 to 2027, with the continued recovery supported by improved investor
confidence, stable electricity supply, lower interest rates and a declining risk premium.
• Continued implementation of structural reforms is essential to accelerate growth, supported by macroeconomic stability, infrastructure
investment and a capable state.
SPENDING PLANS
• Consolidated government spending increases at an annual average of 5.6 per cent, from R2.4 trillion in 2024/25 to R2.83 trillion in 2027/28.
• Over the medium term, economic development is the fastest-growing function at an annual average rate of 8.1 per cent, driven by higher
allocations to infrastructure projects.
• Spending is highly redistributive, with the social wage making up 61 per cent of total consolidated non-interest spending over the next
three years.
• The 2025 Budget funds spending pressures of R232.6 billion over the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) period, including
provisional allocations for frontline service delivery departments amounting to R70.7 billion.
• Additional funding of R46.7 billion is made available for infrastructure investments and R23.4 billion is made available for the 2025 publicservice wage agreement, which provides greater certainty for budget planning for the next three years.
TAX PROPOSALS
• Tax policy proposals are designed to raise R28 billion in additional revenue in 2025/26 and R14.5 billion in 2026/27.
• Government proposes to increase the value-added tax (VAT) rate by 0.5 percentage points in 2025/26 and by 0.5 percentage points in
2026/27. Personal income tax brackets and rebates are not adjusted for inflation in 2025/26.
• To provide relief to lower-income households, government proposes additional VAT zero rating of essential food items and no changes to
the fuel levy.

FOREWORD
Over the past nine months, South Africa has benefited from improved sentiment following
the successful transition to a government of national unity and the stabilisation of electricity
supply. But this optimism needs to be translated into more determined action and
measurable results, specifically in the form of higher economic growth and improved living
standards. The 2025 Budget proposes steps to achieve these outcomes.
Economic growth is projected to average 1.8 per cent over the next three years, and the fiscal
strategy remains on course. Over the medium term, the budget deficit is expected to narrow
to 3.5 per cent of GDP. Crucially, the debt-to-GDP ratio will stabilise at 76.2 per cent in
2025/26, declining thereafter. These are important milestones, but more is needed to change
South Africa’s economic and policy trajectory, particularly given growing external risks.
To boost growth and employment, government is significantly upscaling its infrastructure
delivery programme. There are major opportunities to reduce the backlog in public
infrastructure while creating jobs and boosting economic activity. Accordingly, the regulations
for public-private partnerships have been simplified to attract greater private-sector
participation; multiple windows of the Budget Facility for Infrastructure are being introduced;
and reforms are being made to municipal-owned trading services to ensure they are
financially sustainable and efficiently provide water, electricity and refuse collection. Capital
allocations increase by 8.1 per cent over the next three years, including funding for passenger
rail and disaster reconstruction.
Government aims to improve the capability of the state with measures to strengthen
education, health and defence; continue rebuilding the South African Revenue Service; and
incentivise early retirement to revitalise the public service. The 2025 Budget also confirms
government’s commitment to macroeconomic stability – which lays the foundation for
sustainable growth – by restoring the health of the public finances.
Delivering on this agenda requires difficult decisions. In light of new and persistent spending
pressures, government proposes to increase the value-added tax (VAT) rate by half a
percentage point in 2025/26 and half a percentage point in the following year, bringing VAT
to 16 per cent in 2026/27. This measure enables additional funding in several key areas,
including extending early childhood development coverage; hiring more teachers, doctors
and other critical frontline personnel; and rebuilding the commuter rail system.
To alleviate the impact on low-income households, the budget provides for above-inflation
increases in social grants, expands the list of foods that are zero rated for VAT and extends
fuel levy relief. Over the medium term, new spending pressures must be funded either
through revenue increases or spending reductions or reprioritisations.
I would like to thank Cabinet, the Minister and Deputy Ministers of Finance for their
leadership – and the Parliamentary Committees on Finance and Appropriations, the Budget
Council and my counterparts across government for their contributions to shaping this
budget. Finally, I extend my heartfelt appreciation to my National Treasury colleagues, who
work without fail to fulfil their obligations to the Constitution and the people of South Africa.

2025 BUDGET REVIEW
INVESTING FOR
FASTER GROWTH
CHAPTER 1
INVESTING FOR FASTER GROWTH
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 1
In brief
• The 2025 Budget lays the foundation for faster economic growth and continues to
stabilise the public finances.
• South Africa’s economic outlook is slowly improving, with GDP growth expected to
average 1.8 per cent over the next three years.
• Next year, debt will stabilise at 76.2 per cent of GDP. Debt-service costs, which consume
22 cents of every rand of revenue, stabilise in the current year.
• In light of new and persistent spending pressures, government has decided to raise
additional tax revenues, including proposed value-added tax (VAT) rate increases of half
a percentage point in each of the next two years.
• Investing in strategic infrastructure, supporting job creation and maintaining a growthfriendly fiscal policy will underpin government policy over the medium term.
OVERVIEW
The 2025 Budget maintains government’s focus on growing the economy, stabilising the
public finances, and supporting low-income and vulnerable households.
Over the next three years, GDP growth is projected to average 1.8 per cent. Despite lowerthan-expected economic growth in 2024, regular electricity supply, slowing inflation and
declining interest rates, supported by government’s fiscal strategy, are improving
confidence and enhancing the investment environment.
Government’s economic growth strategy will support higher living standards in the context
of global uncertainty, trade disputes and financial market vulnerabilities. The strategy
focuses on maintaining macroeconomic stability to reduce living costs and grow
investment, executing reforms to promote a more dynamic economy, building state
capability in core functions and supporting growth-enhancing public infrastructure
investment.
The 2025 Budget proposes investments for faster economic growth, focusing on
electricity, rail, water and transportation infrastructure projects. Over the medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) period ahead, no new spending reductions are proposed.
Consolidated spending, excluding interest payments, grows at an annual average rate of
0.8 per cent in real terms, with 61 per cent of spending supporting the social wage –
health, education, social protection, community development and employment
programmes.
FISCAL OUTLOOK
Government’s determination to ensure sustainable public finances puts South Africa in a
stronger position to withstand unforeseen shocks, while creating an environment
conducive to higher investment and faster economic growth. It also enables government
to prioritise investment over debt service, which now consumes 22 cents of every rand of
revenue. The cost of servicing South Africa’s government debt is significantly higher than
in peer countries (Figure 1.1), driving up borrowing costs for households and businesses.
CHAPTER 1
INVESTING FOR FASTER GROWTH
2 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The fiscal strategy remains on course. Over the next year, government expects to reach
two important milestones in rebuilding the public finances. In 2025/26, public debt will
peak, stabilising at 76.2 per cent of GDP (Figure 1.2). This is the result of a growing primary
budget surplus, meaning revenue exceeds non-interest spending. Debt-service costs will
peak in the current year, stabilising at 21.7 per cent of revenue, and decline thereafter.
The consolidated budget deficit is expected to narrow from 5 per cent of GDP this year to
3.5 per cent of GDP in 2027/28.

The 2025 Budget covers the costs of the first three-year public-service wage agreement
since 2018. Although the outcome of the agreement requires additional allocations for
compensation, it is notable that government has secured certainty for the largest item in
the budget without delaying debt stabilisation. At the same time, the early retirement
incentive announced in the 2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) is being
rolled out to reduce compensation costs while rejuvenating the public service.
In response to new and persistent spending pressures, the 2025 Budget proposes a
significant increase in revenue. Most importantly, government has taken the difficult
decision to raise the VAT rate by 0.5 percentage points in each of the next two years,
bringing VAT to 16 per cent in 2026/27. This and other revenue increases will provide
additional funding for several frontline functions, with investments in education, health,
early childhood development and commuter rail services.
Government acknowledges that this measure will place greater pressure on households.
However, the impact is cushioned by the spending support outlined above and across the
budget, such as above-inflation increases in social grants, the extension of fuel levy relief
and the addition of new food items to the basket of goods that are zero rated for VAT.

CHAPTER 1
 INVESTING FOR FASTER GROWTH
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 3
Over the medium term, new spending pressures must be funded either through additional
revenue increases or expenditure reductions or reprioritisations, which may include
eliminating non-performing programmes.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
As outlined in the 2024 MTBPS, government’s medium-term strategy is anchored by four
priorities:
• Maintaining macroeconomic stability
• Implementing structural reforms
• Building state capability
• Supporting growth-enhancing public infrastructure investment.
A sound macroeconomic framework promotes stable prices and low interest rates,
enhancing the economy’s resilience to external shocks that tend to disproportionately
affect poor households. The National Treasury’s macroeconomic policy review, published
in 2024, confirms that inflation targeting has been beneficial for the economy, especially
the poor. Government continues to support effective inflation targeting, along with efforts
to stabilise the public finances.
Chapter 2 outlines the progress made by Operation Vulindlela and in other reforms.
Alongside notable improvements in the electricity and transport sectors, recent reforms
have focused on improving and stabilising water supply. The newly created National Water
Resources Infrastructure Agency will consolidate non-municipal water infrastructure
assets, such as dams and land, to improve planning and financing of water projects.
South Africa needs higher capital investment to accelerate economic growth and create
jobs. This is a central priority for government over the period ahead. Together with
substantial additional resources, the infrastructure delivery mechanism is being reformed
to better support private-sector participation, and improve efficiency and coordination in
the development of critical infrastructure.
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT GROWTH
Over the next three years, an estimated R1.03 trillion will be spent on public infrastructure
projects by state-owned companies, other public entities, and national, provincial and
local government. This includes R402 billion for road infrastructure, with R100 billion of
investments by the South African National Roads Agency Limited. An amount of
R219.2 billion will be spent on energy infrastructure, and R156.3 billion will flow to water
and sanitation infrastructure.
The 2025 Budget adds R46.7 billion in funding for infrastructure projects over the next
three years.
CHAPTER 1
INVESTING FOR FASTER GROWTH
4 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Several reforms under way are designed to help the state deliver infrastructure and
encourage private-sector investment. During 2025/26, a single structure overseen by the
National Treasury will be established to coordinate state participation in project
preparation and planning, public-private partnerships (PPPs), funding and credit
guarantees. It will be established by merging two units currently in the Government
Technical Advisory Centre that coordinate PPPs and capital appraisals with the
Infrastructure Fund in the Development Bank of Southern Africa.
Streamlining the framework for public-private partnerships
Infrastructure reforms are underpinned by a commitment to significantly increase
partnerships with the private sector. On 7 February 2025, amendments to Treasury
Regulations for PPPs were gazetted. From June 2025, projects below a total value of
R2 billion will no longer have to clear onerous approval processes intended for large
projects before proceeding.
A clear framework is being established to receive and process unsolicited PPP proposals or
bids from the private sector. Revised manuals and guidelines on PPPs are being produced
and will be made available to the public. New legislative amendments and regulations for
municipal PPPs will also be introduced in 2025.
Budgeting and financing for infrastructure
Of the total public-sector capital investment planned over the medium term,
72.7 per cent, or R748.5 billion, will be funded from the budgets of state-owned
companies and public entities, as well as municipalities, as shown in Figure 1.3.

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 5
The Budget Facility for Infrastructure plays a central role in the capital budgeting system
by recommending funding for projects that are jointly funded from other sources,
including state-owned companies, municipal own resources and the private sector. For the
2025 Budget cycle, the Facility has approved nine projects with a total value of
R55.5 billion, of which R15.3 billion will be funded by the Facility. The approved projects
address a wide range of service delivery and economic growth needs, such as hospital
infrastructure, transport and logistics, and water. Details are set out in Annexure D.
The 2025 Budget introduces a performance-based conditional grant for certain trading
service entities that provide basic services, such as municipal water. This will incentivise
financial and operational reforms to improve their functioning and sustainability.
OTHER CRITICAL REFORMS
Anchoring fiscal policy for the long term
Between 2011/12 and 2019/20 government spending rose rapidly, mainly driven by
bailouts to state-owned companies and major public entities, transfers to households and
a growing public-service wage bill. As a result, spending grew faster than GDP and revenue.
The result was a high debt burden and significant fiscal vulnerability to external shocks, as
evidenced by the impact of COVID-19 on public finances and the need to implement
difficult spending reductions thereafter.
As the public finances stabilise and fiscal targets are met, government has been exploring
the implementation of strong fiscal policy anchors that will help prevent a recurrence of
the cycle of high spending, high deficits and high debt. At present, a primary budget surplus
sufficient to stabilise debt has been adopted as the anchor. However, the obligation to
keep public debt stable is not explicit in South Africa’s legal and regulatory framework. In
this regard, government is releasing, along with the budget, a discussion document
presenting options for such an anchor. Further detail is provided in Chapter 3.
Early retirement programme for public servants
The 2024 MTBPS announced that government would offer an early retirement incentive.
Over the next two years, the 2025 Budget provides R11 billion in funding to incentivise
public servants to retire early. Those wishing to pursue this option will have to apply, with
approvals given only by the relevant executive authority. Up to 30 000 state employees
are expected to opt for early retirement. The programme aims to manage staff headcount
in a targeted manner and revitalise the public service.
Social protection and employment support
South Africa’s social security system provided R343.3 billion in income support in 2023/24.
This included social assistance grants, unemployment insurance and compensation for
workplace disability. In 2020, the COVID-19 social relief of distress grant was introduced
to compensate low-income workers affected by the lockdown. The state also operates a
CHAPTER 1

number of employment and active labour market programmes to create work, support
the temporarily unemployed and promote entrepreneurship. As announced in the
2024 MTBPS, the social protection and employment support programmes are being
reviewed. This work, which has proceeded more slowly than anticipated, will continue
during 2025/26.
Considerations for future budget processes
Extended Cabinet deliberations led to the postponement of the tabling of the 2025 Budget
in Parliament from February to March 2025.
Timelines for legislative consideration and executive implementation of budgets are
outlined in various acts of Parliament, including the Public Finance Management Act
(1999). In view of recent developments, government will reflect on improvements or
reforms that can strengthen the national budget process. This review will include options
for enhancing political and technical engagements on the budget, clarifying the role of
certain structures that provide inputs to the budget, enhancing public consultation and
improving the information technology used to develop the budget presentation.

Fiscal outlook
The consolidated budget deficit is projected to continue declining over the medium term,
narrowing to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2027/28. Gross loan debt will stabilise at 76.2 per cent
of GDP in 2025/26. Debt-service costs will rise from R389.6 billion in 2024/25 to
R478.6 billion in 2027/28, but as a percentage of revenue, debt-service costs stabilise at
21.7 per cent in 2024/25. Chapter 3 provides information on fiscal performance and
projections, and details the fiscal strategy.

Revenue trends and tax proposals
Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive overview of revenue trends and tax proposals. Gross
tax revenue for 2024/25 is expected to be R1.85 trillion, which is R16.7 billion below the
2024 Budget projection. Over the next three years, tax revenue is expected to increase
from R2.01 trillion in 2025/26 to R2.31 trillion in 2027/28, with an average tax-to-GDP ratio
of 25.3 per cent over the same period. Tax policy measures proposed in the 2025 Budget
will raise R28 billion in additional revenue in 2025/26 and R14.5 billion in 2026/27.

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 9
As discussed in Chapter 5, spending is highly redistributive. The social wage accounts for
61 per cent of total non-interest spending over the next three years. The 2025 Budget
funds spending pressures of R232.6 billion over the MTEF period, including provisional
allocations for frontline service delivery departments amounting to R70.7 billion.
Division of revenue
Over the 2025 MTEF period, excluding payments for servicing debt, the contingency
reserve and provisional allocations, 48.4 per cent of nationally raised revenues are
allocated to national government, 41.9 per cent to provinces and 9.7 per cent to local
government. The division of revenue between the three spheres of government is outlined
in Chapter 6, which also discusses structural reforms to improve revenue generation,
efficiency and accountability in provinces and municipalities.
Government debt and contingent liabilities
Chapter 7 reviews government debt and contingent liabilities. Gross government debt is
projected to reach R5.69 trillion or 76.1 per cent of GDP this year, stabilising at
76.2 per cent of GDP in 2025/26. Debt stabilises at a slightly higher level than projected in
the 2024 MTBPS but still achieves the overall policy objective. Debt-service costs are
expected to stabilise as a percentage of revenue in the current year.

Financial position of public-sector institutions
State-owned companies and major public entities continue to pose a large risk to the fiscal
position. As outlined in the 2024 Fiscal Risk Statement (Annexure A of the MTBPS), most
contingent liabilities emanate from these institutions. The 2025 Budget maintains
government’s stance of not providing bailouts to state-owned companies. Government is
focused on improving governance and the effectiveness and transparency of the
guarantee framework. In addition, government will support critical capital investments
through different mechanisms, including credit guarantees, on-lending and grant funding,
where appropriate. Chapter 8 discusses the financial position of public-sector institutions.
BUDGET DOCUMENTATION
The 2025 Budget is accompanied by several other documents and submissions to
Parliament. These include:

CHAPTER 2
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 11
In brief
• Real economic growth is forecast to increase to 1.9 per cent in 2025.
• Lower-than-expected growth in 2024 is due to unanticipated weaknesses in agriculture
and transport during the third quarter.
• Economic growth is projected to average 1.8 per cent from 2025 to 2027, with the
continued recovery supported by improved investor confidence, stable electricity
supply, lower interest rates and a declining risk premium.
• Continued implementation of structural reforms is essential to accelerate growth,
supported by macroeconomic stability, infrastructure investment and a capable state.
OVERVIEW
South Africa’s economy is forecast to grow at an average of 1.8 per cent over the next
three years as momentum starts to pick up after more than a decade of stagnant growth.
The medium-term outlook is supported by higher investment and household
consumption, aided by a stable inflation outlook, moderate employment gains and
improving household balance sheets. Continued easing of structural constraints will
support the economy by fostering additional investment – including in infrastructure.
To bolster growth and employment, government’s economic strategy prioritises:
• Maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing volatility to reduce the cost of
living and encourage investment.
• Implementing structural reforms to increase efficiency and promote a competitive
economy, while addressing constraints to job creation and employment.
• Building state capability by identifying and solving problems in the delivery of core
functions, supported by digital transformation.
• Supporting growth-enhancing public infrastructure investment to increase
productivity and long-term economic prospects.
ENHANCING ECONOMIC GROWTH
A macroeconomic framework to support growth
A sound macroeconomic framework promotes stable prices and low interest rates,
enhancing the economy’s resilience to external shocks that tend to disproportionately
affect poor households. Prudent fiscal policy in combination with moderate and stable
inflation reduces uncertainty, lowering the sovereign risk premium. These factors in turn
bring down borrowing costs, anchor investment expectations and boost confidence,
promoting economic growth. South Africa’s sovereign risk premium has declined since
June 2023, but fiscal risks remain elevated. Debt-service costs consume 22 cents out of
every rand of revenue and are growing faster than GDP. This underlines the need to
CHAPTER 2
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
12 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
improve the sustainability of public finances by bringing debt under control, while
prioritising measures that directly enhance productivity and growth.
Catalysing economic growth through structural reforms
The first phase of Operation Vulindlela supported economic growth by alleviating power
cuts, improving logistics performance, reducing data costs, enhancing water supply,
attracting needed skills and supporting tourism. These reforms had significant benefits for
the investment environment, as reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index,
which in the fourth quarter of 2024 reached its highest level since mid-2021. Yet far more
is needed to raise productivity and inclusive growth in a manner that does not lead to
higher inflation.
Reforms under way in the rail, energy and water sectors will improve the functioning of
these services to ensure businesses can produce more efficiently and investors can plan
for the future.
In logistics, Transnet’s freight volumes continue to be monitored against recovery plan
targets. The utility’s interim results show a 3.2 per cent improvement in freight rail
volumes in the first six months of 2024/25 relative to the previous financial year. The
Transport Economic Regulator, which begins operating on 1 April 2025, will consolidate
the regulation of transport sectors and promote competition to improve efficiency.
Together with the National Logistics Crisis Committee, it will advance private-sector
participation and support investment in logistics.
Electricity generation capacity continues to recover. Between April and December 2024,
the energy availability factor averaged 62.4 per cent – 7.1 percentage points higher than
the same period in 2023. This coincided with a reduction in unplanned power cuts
(Figure 2.1) and increased planned maintenance. Scheduled power cuts were suspended
between 27 March 2024 and 30 January 2025. Additionally, household solar panels and
private-sector generation projects continued to increase photovoltaic (PV) output.

The Electricity Regulation Amendment Act (2024), which will establish a competitive
market for long-term energy security, took effect on 1 January 2025. Market rules and
procedures are being finalised and preparations to license the National Transmission
Company of South Africa as a market operator are under way. Government is considering
unbundling electricity tariffs into their different cost components, which would enhance
transparency and fair cost recovery – and facilitate a competitive wholesale market.
Additional projects from government’s 360-megawatt battery storage programme have
reached close and will soon proceed to construction. Raising the embedded generation
licensing threshold has catalysed private-sector energy projects. The 2024 South African
Renewable Energy Grid Survey identified 133 gigawatts of potential in wind, solar and
battery storage, but grid expansion is critical to support these projects.
In the water sector, the focus remains on improving municipal water services and
promoting private-sector participation. Efforts are under way to introduce an independent
economic regulator to ensure fair pricing and sustainable management of water services.
The municipal turnaround strategy focuses on addressing critical maintenance backlogs,
ensuring skilled personnel are in place and fast-tracking infrastructure investments to
stabilise service delivery. A recent report on water-sector investment requirements
estimated that R256 billion will be required annually between 2023 and 2050, totalling
R7.2 trillion, to achieve water security and access for all.1
 The National Water Programme
aims to address investment gaps, with initial commitments from the New Development
Bank and the City of Cape Town.
Boosting growth through a capable state
Building a capable state goes beyond capacity-building initiatives focused on individual
skills, focusing instead on accountability arrangements, strategic goals, government
systems and state organisation. This approach is the basis of interventions described in
chapters 1, 3 and 6, including institutional reforms to improve the delivery of
infrastructure, additional resources to support rebuilding the South African Revenue
Service, and an early retirement initiative to rationalise and rejuvenate the public service.
The second phase of Operation Vulindlela will consider and introduce reforms to improve
municipal accountability and capacity. Reforms designed to overcome spatial inequalities,
turn cities into engines of economic activity and improve the ability of local government
to deliver services will support higher growth and job creation.
In addition, government is driving digital transformation to support service delivery.
Reforms include relaunching the government website for improved access to services;
implementing digital identity and payment systems; growing data interoperability by
establishing data exchange for research and service delivery; and increasing access to data
and information for transparency and accountability through the publication of a

procurement payments dashboard. The Integrated Financial Management System will
provide critical infrastructure and data capabilities needed to enhance financial oversight,
automate processes and support greater integration and responsiveness.
Supporting growth-enhancing public infrastructure
Government is tackling regulatory concerns to encourage private investment in public
infrastructure. Amendments to the public-private partnership framework will simplify
processes and reduce delays. Efforts focus on improving investment in transport,
communication, water and energy to reduce costs, boost efficiency and raise productivity.
Over the past decade, deteriorating infrastructure, electricity disruptions, crime,
corruption, weak investment and poor education outcomes have reduced the economy’s
growth potential, or trend growth. South Africa’s potential growth is estimated to have
remained below 2 per cent since 2013, falling to an average of less than 1 per cent over
the past four years. Raising potential growth is necessary to ensure a sustainable increase
in growth – in other words, to expand the economy without stoking inflation or
accumulating excessive debt. Productivity – the efficiency with which the economy uses
its resources – is one of the main drivers of long-term trend growth.
Implementation of the four priorities outlined above will boost short-term economic
growth, while supporting higher potential growth over the longer term.

GLOBAL OUTLOOK
The International Monetary Fund projects that global growth will stabilise at 3.3 per cent
in 2025 and 2026. In the short term, growth in the United States will benefit from robust
consumption and investment, while China’s expansion will be supported by fiscal
measures to counter investment weakness. Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East
and Central Asia is expected to increase in 2025 despite the drag from commodity
production cuts. However, geopolitical tensions – including the threat of sharpening trade

disputes – alongside slow productivity gains and trade and supply chain adjustments could
limit growth across regions.
Global headline inflation is projected to ease from 5.7 per cent in 2024 to 4.2 per cent in
2025 and 3.5 per cent in 2026, driven by declining energy prices and cooling labour
markets. Advanced economies are expected to return to their inflation targets faster than
emerging economies, supported by moderating energy costs and improved labour supply.
Inflation trends vary in emerging economies, with food inflation persisting in Sub-Saharan
Africa, while China is experiencing subdued inflation given weak domestic demand.
DOMESTIC OUTLOOK
The National Treasury projects real GDP growth of 1.9 per cent in 2025, from a
downwardly revised estimate of 0.8 per cent growth in 2024. The downward adjustment
is due to a third-quarter GDP contraction driven by weak activity reported for agriculture
and transport. Fourth-quarter growth figures show an improvement, reflecting higher
consumer spending in response to easing inflation and the onset of the two-pot retirement
reform, which is discussed in Chapter 4.
GDP growth is expected to average 1.8 per cent from 2025 to 2027. Medium-term growth
will be underpinned by household consumption on the back of rising purchasing power,
moderate employment recovery and wealth gains. Continued investments in renewable
energy and easing structural constraints are expected to support higher investment. Key
factors for achieving faster economic growth and creating much-needed jobs include
greater collaboration with the private sector in energy and transport, rapid
implementation of structural reforms, easing of regulatory constraints and increased
infrastructure investment.

CHAPTER 2
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
16 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Employment
The pace of employment growth is expected to have slowed in 2024, with average growth
for the first three quarters at 2.2 per cent compared with an average of 6.2 per cent in
2023. Although employment reached an all-time high of 16.9 million people in the third
quarter of 2024, the year-to-date average unemployment rate of 32.8 per cent exceeds
the long-term average of 27.5 per cent as labour force growth outpaces economic growth.
Over the medium term, employment growth is expected to increase gradually, in line with
GDP.
South Africa’s employment rate – the percentage of the working-age population that is
employed – is about 40 per cent, far below the global average of 55–65 per cent.
Compared with similar economies, South Africa has low levels of agricultural employment,
self-employment and informal economic activity. Addressing this challenge requires
stronger economic growth, and labour demand and absorption.
Several regulatory obstacles hinder South Africa’s ability to create jobs. Amendments to
labour market regulations to boost employment have been considered by the National
Economic Development and Labour Council. The reform process has centred on
simplifying labour regulations – including hiring and dismissal, enhanced protections for
vulnerable workers and greater flexibility – with a particular focus on small businesses.
Updates will be provided as the process unfolds.
Inflation
Headline inflation declined to 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2024, resulting in
average inflation of 4.4 per cent for the year. Consumer inflation is projected to average
4.3 per cent in 2025 and 4.6 per cent in 2026, picking up slightly as the value-added tax
(VAT) increase pushes up prices. The VAT effect is seen mainly in core inflation, which,
after averaging 4.3 per cent in 2024, is projected to rise to 4.6 per cent in 2026. Lower
global crude oil prices are expected to support muted fuel price inflation.

Household consumption
Household consumption growth averaged 0.6 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024
compared with the same period in 2023. Household expenditure is expected to grow by
1 per cent in 2024 and 1.9 per cent in 2025. Despite weaker growth momentum,
household consumption will be supported in the near term by stable inflation
expectations, lower borrowing costs, withdrawals under the two-pot retirement reform
and government transfers to poorer households. Consumer confidence improved
gradually throughout 2024, driven by lower inflation, stable electricity supply and
domestic political developments. Household consumption is forecast to average
1.7 per cent from 2025 to 2027, supported by enhanced consumer sentiment, increased
household purchasing power, gradual employment gains and wage recovery, and
increased credit extension.
Investment
Gross fixed-capital formation contracted by 4.4 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024,
largely led by the private sector. Capital expenditure categories showed mixed results in
the third quarter of 2024, with construction works up but residential and transport
equipment investments down due to high borrowing costs and low confidence. Total fixed
investment remains 9.6 per cent below the pre-pandemic level, mainly owing to weak
private investment. Gross fixed-capital formation is estimated to have contracted by
3.6 per cent in 2024, following two years of growth. It is expected to rebound to 5 per cent
in 2025 and average 4.6 per cent over the medium term. The stronger outlook will be
supported by the global recovery, lower interest rates, an increase in major export
commodity prices and the rollout of public infrastructure investment.

Balance of payments
The current account deficit is expected to widen from 1.6 per cent of GDP in 2024 to
2.3 per cent of GDP in 2025, averaging 2.4 per cent over the medium term. This is due to
a larger deficit on the net services, income and current transfers account. Easing logistical
constraints, stable electricity supply and improvements in export commodity prices should
support export volumes. Import volume growth in the near term will be supported by
easing oil prices, higher domestic demand and energy-related fixed investment. However,
the risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, including geopolitical tensions, trade
policy uncertainty and a slower-than-anticipated easing of logistical bottlenecks.
Figure 2.5 Current account balance
Source: Reserve Bank
Macroeconomic assumptions
Global demand growth is expected to recover from an estimated 2.9 per cent in 2024 to
3.8 per cent in 2025 as growth rises among South Africa’s major trading partners. Despite
easing prices compared with 2023, the overall export commodity price assumption has
been revised upwards due to heightened geopolitical risk, strong US demand and steady
Chinese imports, as well as lower output from key producers. The oil price assumption
remains unchanged from the 2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS).
The sovereign risk premium averaged 3.1 per cent in 2024 – a small improvement from
the expectation at the time of the 2024 MTBPS – and is expected to stabilise at 2.7 per cent
over the medium term, compared with 3 per cent projected at the time of the MTBPS.

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 19
Comparing the baseline forecast with optimistic and pessimistic scenarios
The National Treasury has modelled two alternative scenarios to the baseline forecast.
The upside Scenario A models a rapid infrastructure investment programme, supported by
a successful scale-up of capital spending by public entities. Investments increase energy
supply more than forecast, and rail and ports recover lost ground in transport volumes. As
a result, productive capacity and business and investor confidence pick up, reducing the
sovereign risk premium. Producer and consumer inflation decline in the short term, settling
at the midpoint of the target in the medium term. Real GDP growth increases to a high of
2.7 per cent in 2025, reaching 2.6 per cent in 2032 due to higher capital stock accumulation
and productivity, supporting increased trade volumes and boosting potential growth. This
implies that the additional GDP generated over the simulation period amounts to
R1.06 trillion relative to the baseline.
The downside Scenario B models a once-off shock of slowing global growth due to
increased trade fragmentation and uncertainty. Restrictive trade policies and bloc divisions
weaken global trade and investment. Rising costs, persistent supply constraints and sticky
inflation limit major central banks’ ability to cut rates, while subdued business activity and
weak demand weigh on trade sentiment. In South Africa, import inflation, low exports and
subdued global demand, combined with higher interest rates and foreign capital costs,
reduce GDP growth to 1.5 per cent in 2025 and 1.6 per cent in 2026. Inflation exceeds the
baseline in the short term. Beyond 2026, growth returns to the baseline trajectory.
Although the growth rate catches up to the baseline over the medium term, GDP losses
accumulate to R226 billion relative to the baseline over the horizon.

Risks to the outlook
Risks to the domestic outlook are balanced, but the global outlook faces downside risks
from rising trade disputes and geopolitical tensions, financial market volatility, tightening
financial conditions for developing economies, rising commodity prices and China’s
property sector slowdown. Domestically, fiscal risks, adverse weather events, rising input
costs and logistical issues could threaten growth. Conversely, lower interest rates, greaterthan-expected withdrawals from the two-pot retirement system and progress on
economic reforms could boost confidence and demand.
SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK
Agriculture
Gross value added in the agriculture sector fell by 15.5 per cent over the first three
quarters of 2024 compared with 2023, driven by a major contraction reported for the third
quarter. Production of summer crops such as maize, soybeans and sunflowers was
affected by El Niño-linked heatwaves, while the livestock sector recovered following the
avian influenza outbreak in 2023. A rebound is anticipated in 2025 as a weak La Niña brings
higher rainfall and lower temperatures, and the livestock sector continues to recover. A
strong export-oriented horticulture season is expected over the medium term.
Mining
Gross value added in the mining sector expanded by 0.6 per cent in the first nine months
of 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Production remains subdued due to rail
and port constraints affecting bulk commodities, low commodity prices and consequential
business restructuring affecting platinum group metals. Safety stoppages, unrest and
crime also weighed on production. Improved energy availability, reduced logistics
constraints and the introduction of a new mining cadastre system – used to track mineral
rights and related licensing information – should support the sector over the medium
term.
Manufacturing
Gross value added in the manufacturing sector was 0.3 per cent lower in the first three
quarters of 2024 relative to 2023. Production declined by 0.4 per cent during this period,
driven by decreases in the production of motor vehicles, parts and accessories and other
transport equipment. Although weak demand and competition from imports persist,
consistent energy supply, lower borrowing costs and accelerated implementation of
reforms in energy and transport are boosting the outlook.
Construction
The construction sector contracted by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024
relative to 2023. Improved policy certainty boosted investment sentiment, but activity
CHAPTER 2
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 21
remains slow. The so-called construction mafia – organised extortion gangs that use
violence to gain a share of lucrative projects – continue to disrupt projects in KwaZuluNatal, Gauteng and the Western Cape. Government and industry stakeholders have
agreed on an approach to end criminal disruption at sites. A recovery is expected during
2025 as sentiment rises and interest rates ease.
Construction sector multipliers
Government’s plans to forge an inclusive growth path include large-scale investment in
infrastructure, with the construction sector at centre stage.
Figure 2.7 shows that for every R1 million in construction output, total domestic output expands
by R1.86 million. Although the sector is small, accounting for only 3 per cent of total gross value
added in 2023, it has strong connections to the broader economy. The 2024 MTBPS noted that
the construction sector has the highest employment multiplier of any sector: every R1 million
spent on a construction project creates more than three jobs for individuals whose highest
qualification is a matric certificate. Sectors such as transport, storage and communication,
domestic trade sales, mining and quarrying, finance, personal services and manufacturing are
poised to benefit most from a construction stimulus.

construction sector output by R1 million*
*Based on the 2021 social accounting matrix
Source: Statistics South Africa and National Treasury
Utilities
The electricity, gas and water sector expanded by 4.4 per cent in the first nine months of
2024 relative to 2023, reflecting sustained improvements in Eskom’s operational
performance. Many reforms are still under way, including those aimed at increasing
generation capacity and establishing a competitive wholesale electricity market. This
should support long-term energy security, alongside efforts to address grid availability and
structural challenges within the distribution industry.
Transport and communication
The transport, storage and communication sector expanded by 0.1 per cent in the first
nine months of 2024 compared with 2023. Ongoing rail constraints, inefficient port
operations and decelerating road transport have weighed on output. Increased
investments to improve operations and expand rail and port capacity should support
recovery over the medium term. The telecommunications sector will receive a boost from
5G expansion, spectrum releases and a focus on digital transformation.

Finance and business services
The finance, real estate and business services sector grew by 3.3 per cent in the first nine
months of 2024 compared with 2023, driven by improved investor sentiment and
commercial bank income. Household financial distress from rising interest rates since late
2021 has led to mortgage defaults, but easing borrowing costs are expected to support
the sector. In response to higher non-performing loans in retail and small, medium and
micro enterprises in 2024, banks increased provisions for doubtful exposures as a safety
buffer. Real estate expectations for business volumes and conditions have improved, but
limited rate cuts could hinder the recovery.
CONCLUSION
The growth outlook underscores the opportunity to move to a significantly faster
economic growth path through sustained progress in raising investment and productivity.
The outlook will be supported by stable macroeconomic policies, improved efficiency and
competitiveness driven by structural reforms, enhanced state capability to deliver services
and improved infrastructure investment over the medium term.
2025 BUDGET REVIEW
FISCAL POLICY
CHAPTER 3
FISCAL POLICY
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 23
In brief
• Government’s fiscal strategy is on track to strengthen the public finances.
• The consolidated budget deficit is projected to narrow from 5 per cent of GDP in
2024/25 to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2027/28.
• The primary budget surplus will enable government to stabilise debt by the end of
2025/26.
• Debt‑service costs are forecast to peak as a share of revenue this year, declining
gradually thereafter.
• The fiscal strategy blends critical spending measures, including for essential services
and infrastructure investments, with revenue increases.
OVERVIEW
The 2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) set out a pro-growth agenda to
address South Africa’s economic and fiscal challenges. The 2025 Budget reaffirms
government’s commitment to raise living standards by implementing economic reforms,
expanding infrastructure investment and stabilising debt. This year, government projects
a main budget primary surplus of 0.5 per cent of GDP, which will increase to 0.9 per cent
in 2025/26, stabilising debt as a share of GDP.
The 2025 Budget proposes tax revenue increases to fund new and persistent spending
pressures. These measures are expected to raise R28 billion in additional tax revenue in
2025/26 and R14.5 billion in 2026/27, mainly by not adjusting personal income tax
brackets for inflation and increasing the value-added tax (VAT) rate by 0.5 percentage
points in each of the next two years. The additional revenue will be used to increase
funding for key public services, including education, health and commuter rail. The impact
of the tax measures on the most vulnerable households will be cushioned by real increases
in social grants, an expansion of the list of zero-rated foods and continued fuel levy relief.
Over the medium term, new spending pressures will need to be addressed through
expenditure reductions, reprioritisations or additional revenue measures.
The fiscal strategy remains on track. Prudent and sustainable fiscal policy, in combination
with the economic strategy set out in chapters 1 and 2, is laying the foundation for faster
economic growth and job creation. Servicing the country’s large public debt now
consumes 22 cents of every rand of main budget revenue. Reducing these costs is critical
for national development. As debt-service costs decline, some of the savings will be used
to build fiscal buffers.
FISCAL POLICY TRENDS
South Africa’s fiscal framework and debt dynamics deteriorated significantly in the
aftermath of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis as economic growth fell below historical
averages. At the same time, increases in public-service wages and transfers to households,
and rising debt-service costs, created a growing divergence between government
spending and available resources, which are raised mainly through tax revenues.
CHAPTER 3
FISCAL POLICY
24 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Government debt rose from R1.79 trillion in 2014/15 to R5.26 trillion in 2023/24.
Measured in inflation-adjusted terms, the burden of public debt per working-age
individual climbed from R70 074 in 2014/15 to R114 976 in 2023/24, while real interest
costs per individual jumped from R4 472 to R7 785 over the same period. During this
decade of economic underperformance, real GDP per person fell from R80 046 to R74 599,
underscoring how economic stagnation intensified pressure on households and the
broader economy.
The adoption of a main budget expenditure ceiling in 2012 constrained growth in noninterest expenditure. However, rapid growth in debt-service costs, above-inflation wage
settlements and repeated bailouts of public enterprises – as well as shocks such as COVID19 – saw total consolidated government spending rise sharply from R1.23 trillion in
2014/15 to R2.26 trillion in 2023/24, outpacing average annual inflation of 5.2 per cent.

Despite this increase in total spending, there was no corresponding improvement in
economic output. Infrastructure investment declined as a share of total expenditure,
indicating a shift towards current consumption at the expense of future growth
(Figure 3.2), while debt-service costs absorbed a growing proportion of main budget
revenue.

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 25
MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL STRATEGY
The fiscal strategy continues to strike a balance between stabilising the public finances,
reducing risks in the fiscal framework, encouraging economic growth and supporting lowincome and vulnerable households. Over the medium term, the strategy prioritises:
• A fiscal anchor to support responsible borrowing and spending. In 2025/26, the debtstabilising main budget primary surplus will serve as the fiscal anchor, with larger
primary surpluses planned for the remainder of the decade to reduce debt as a
proportion of GDP.
• An additional R28 billion in revenue in 2025/26 through an increase in the VAT rate,
no inflationary adjustments to personal income tax brackets and other measures.
• Growth-enhancing public investment by ensuring that payments for capital assets at
a consolidated level grow faster than inflation.
• Continued support for frontline services and the vulnerable by allocating 61 per cent
of consolidated non-interest spending to the social wage – that is, spending on health,
education, social protection, community development and employment
programmes. This includes above-inflation increasesto social grants to help offset the
impact of the VAT increase among vulnerable households.
The 2025 public-service wage agreement covers a three-year period, in contrast with
recent contracts that have covered only one or two years. This agreement will support
greater certainty in budget planning.
ELEMENTS OF THE MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
Strengthening fiscal sustainability and accountability
While a debt-stabilising primary surplus will anchor fiscal policy over the rest of the
decade, government has initiated consultations on potential longer-term fiscal anchors.
Alongside the 2025 Budget, government is publishing a discussion document that outlines
options and trade-offs.
The assessment of fiscal anchors is based on the premise that governments should make
revenue or expenditure choices that are affordable without compromising important
social and economic programmes for future generations. The discussion document
reviews global experience with fiscal anchors and assesses how institutions can be
reformed to strengthen the sustainability of budget practices. It focuses on procedural
reforms, rather than numerical limits, given their positive impact on transparency and
accountability.
At the same time, government continues to explore ways to balance fiscal sustainability
with developmental objectives, so that public resources can be targeted effectively for
social and economic impact. Enhanced fiscal risk analysis, economic forecasting and
oversight of off-budget entities will reinforce the credibility of the fiscal framework. To
CHAPTER 3
FISCAL POLICY
26 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
ensure this process benefits from meaningful public engagement, the National Treasury is
soliciting views and inviting debate with all interested parties on suitable reforms to
balance sustainable public finances and development needs.
Tax policy measures
Since 2020, government has signalled that increases in spending need to be matched by
corresponding revenue measures. In preparing the current tax proposals, government
reviewed all major tax instruments. As detailed in Chapter 4, the VAT rate – unchanged
since 2018 – remains below the average of peer countries, and raising VAT tends to be less
harmful to growth than other tax options. Government seeks to raise an additional
R28 billion in the coming fiscal year. This will mainly be achieved by not adjusting the
personal income tax brackets for inflation and increasing the VAT rate by 0.5 percentage
points. The VAT rate will be increased by an additional 0.5 percentage points in 2026/27
to reach 16 per cent.
To limit the impact of VAT on the poor, government currently zero rates 21 essential food
items. Government now proposes to extend zero rating to several more food items that
are consumed in many low-income households.
Pro-growth infrastructure and social spending allocations
The main budget adds R46.7 billion to infrastructure plans over the medium term, partially
offset by a drawdown on the provisional allocation of R24.6 billion from the Infrastructure
Fund. Capital payments are the fastest-growing area of spending by economic
classification. Government is also undertaking reforms to improve the efficiency of
infrastructure financing and build the pipeline of blended finance projects. Additional
infrastructure reforms are outlined in Chapter 6 and Annexure D of the Budget Review.
Allocations to the social wage will account for 61 per cent of consolidated non-interest
spending to support low-income and vulnerable households over the medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) period.
A sustainable public-service wage agreement
In terms of the 2025 public-service wage agreement, remuneration of government
employees will rise by 5.5 per cent in 2025/26 – 1 percentage point above projected
consumer price index (CPI) inflation. Over the subsequent two years, remuneration of
employees will align with CPI. This agreement will cost the fiscus an additional R7.3 billion
in 2025/26, R7.8 billion in 2026/27 and R8.2 billion in 2027/28. Government will partially
draw down on the contingency reserve to meet these costs. Although the agreement
exceeds the 2024 Budget and MTBPS projections, its three-year duration reduces
uncertainty in budget planning.
In addition, government is reactivating early retirement without penalties to help manage
wage costs. An amount of R11 billion is allocated over the next two fiscal years for this
initiative. The plan is to manage headcounts by incentivising employees over 55 years old
CHAPTER 3

to retire and moderate compensation spending as new recruits join the public service at
entry-level salary grades. Preliminary savings are expected to average R7.1 billion per year
over the medium to long term. Savings will be retained by departments.
CHANGES IN REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE
Revenue
Since the 2024 MTBPS, gross tax revenue projections have been revised up by R5.6 billion
in 2024/25 and by R137.8 billion over the 2025 MTEF period.
Relative to the 2024 MTBPS, non-tax revenue estimates have been lowered by R3.3 billion
in the outer two years of the MTEF period, mainly driven by lower projections for mineral
and petroleum royalties. The R4 billion revenue expected from the sale of strategic oil
reserves will flow to the National Revenue Fund in 2025/26. Projections for National
Revenue Fund receipts have been revised up by R1 billion in 2025/26, mainly due to higher
expected revaluation profits on foreign-currency transactions.
Payments to the Southern African Customs Union have been revised up by R2.2 billion in
2026/27 and R5.4 billion in 2027/28 compared with the 2024 MTBPS estimates, mainly
due to upward revisions to customs duties projections.
Overall, compared with the 2024 Budget estimates, main budget revenue is projected to
be R17.5 billion lower in 2024/25 and, in total, R55.4 billion higher in 2025/26 and
2026/27, mainly reflecting the impact of tax increases.

Expenditure
Main budget non-interest expenditure increased by a net R6.9 billion in 2024/25
compared with the 2024 Budget projection. This was mainly as a result of the proposed
spending additions for rollovers, the troop deployment in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the repayment of debt for the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project and
spending announced in the 2024 Budget, including an increase in the COVID-19 social relief
of distress grant. These increases are partially offset by declared unspent funds, projected
underspending, and drawdowns of the contingency reserve and provisional allocations.

It shows a net increase of R142 billion compared with the 2024 Budget. This increase
comprises spending additions partially offset by reductions in provisional allocations of
R66.7 billion and a R21.3 billion drawdown of the contingency reserve. Details on spending
additions appear in Table 5.2.
CONSOLIDATED FISCAL FRAMEWORK
The consolidated budget deficit for 2024/25, projected at 4.5 per cent of GDP in the
2024 Budget, is now estimated at 5 per cent. The deficit is projected to decline to
3.5 per cent of GDP in 2027/28 as the main budget deficit narrows. Social security funds,
provinces and public entities move into a combined cash deficit in 2024/25 and over the
medium term. Over the next three years, consolidated non-interest expenditure will
increase at an annual average rate of 0.8 per cent in real terms.
The budgets for basic education, health and the police are projected to grow in nominal
annual average terms at 5.9 per cent, 5.9 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively over the
MTEF period. Spending on the community and economic development functions will grow
by 4.5 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively.
Medium-term capital payments and transfers will grow by a nominal annual average of
6.6 per cent. The wage bill and goods and services will increase by 5.7 per cent and
5.4 per cent respectively. The consolidated budget deficit is largely driven by the capital
financing requirement.

ELEMENTS OF THE CONSOLIDATED BUDGET
The consolidated budget includes the main budget framework and spending by provinces,
social security funds and public entities financed from their own revenue sources.
Main budget framework
Table 3.7 summarises spending financed from the National Revenue Fund. In 2023/24, the
main budget deficit outcome of 4.6 per cent of GDP was close to the 2024 Budget estimate
of 4.7 per cent of GDP. The 2024/25 main budget deficit is projected at 4.7 per cent of
GDP, compared with 4.3 per cent in the 2024 Budget, due to weaker growth and lower
revenue.
Relative to the 2024 MTBPS projections, higher main budget primary surpluses and lower
budget deficits are projected in 2026/27 and 2027/28, as higher spending is more than
offset by higher revenue. Debt-service costs have been revised up by R12.1 billion over the
MTEF period. The deficit is expected to continue narrowing over the medium term, from
4.4 per cent of GDP in 2025/26 to 3.3 per cent by 2027/28.
Government proposes to maintain a R21.6 billion contingency reserve over the MTEF
period to manage major unanticipated risks.

Social security funds, public entities and provincial balances
In 2023/24, public entities, social security funds and provinces recorded a combined cash
surplus. The social security funds cash surplus was mainly the result of underspending in
social benefits payments by the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Over the medium term,
public entities are projected to run cash deficits, mainly due to higher capital spending by
the South African National Roads Agency Limited, the Passenger Rail Agency of South
Africa, the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority and the water boards.
PUBLIC-SECTOR BORROWING REQUIREMENT
In 2023/24, the public-sector borrowing requirement rose to R395.1 billion, or 5.6 per cent
of GDP, reflecting the widening of the consolidated budget deficit. The borrowing

multi-year agreement and the early retirement initiative reduce compensation risks over
the period ahead. Medium- to longer-term risks to the fiscal outlook include:
• Lower economic growth, leading to weaker revenue growth.
• The poor financial condition of subnational governments and state-owned
companies.
• Macro-fiscal shocks due to heightened geopolitical tensions.
Determined application of the fiscal strategy, in concert with economic policy initiatives
and a firm stance on state-owned company bailout requests, will mitigate these risks.
CONCLUSION
Government will achieve a longstanding ambition to stabilise debt next year through the
strengthening primary surplus. The fiscal strategy will continue to manage fiscal risks,
support essential services and encourage economic growth.

REVENUE TRENDS AND TAX PROPOSALS
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 33
In brief
• The revised tax revenue estimate for 2024/25 is R1.85 trillion, which is R16.7 billion less
than expected in the 2024 Budget.
• To address spending needs, tax policy proposals are designed to raise R28 billion in
additional revenue in 2025/26 and R14.5 billion in 2026/27.
• Government proposes to increase the value-added tax (VAT) rate by 0.5 percentage
points in 2025/26 and by 0.5 percentage points in 2026/27.
• To provide relief to lower-income households, government proposes additional VAT zero
rating of essential food items and no changes to the fuel levy.
• Building on the progress made in revitalising the South African Revenue Service (SARS),
government will continue to protect and broaden the tax base.
OVERVIEW
The tax system raises the revenue needed to fund government programmes and deliver
services. Tax revenue for 2024/25 is expected to amount to R1.85 trillion, which is
R16.7 billion less than projected at the time of the 2024 Budget. In light of new and
persistent spending pressures, government has decided to raise the VAT rate by
0.5 percentage points in each of the next two years, which will bring VAT to 16 per cent in
2026/27, and to not adjust the personal income tax brackets and rebates for inflation in
2025/26. The increase in tax revenue from these measures enables additional funding for
several key functions and policy priorities, as outlined in other parts of the Budget Review.
Tax policy measures proposed in the 2025 Budget are designed to raise R28 billion in
additional revenue in 2025/26 and R14.5 billion in 2026/27. A VAT increase affects
everyone, and government is mitigating the adverse effects for lower-income households,
including through above-inflation increases to social grants, not increasing the general fuel
levy, and expanding the list of foods zero rated for VAT. Other tax proposals include no
inflation adjustments to medical tax credits, above-inflation increases on alcohol and
tobacco excise duties, and diesel refund relief for primary sectors.
Government remains committed to broadening the tax base and improving tax
administration to support sustainable revenue collection and economic growth.
REVENUE COLLECTION AND OUTLOOK
Revenue collection has fallen short of expectations over the past year in line with
economic outcomes. The tax-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase marginally from
24.5 per cent in 2023/24 to 24.7 per cent in 2024/25.
Although corporate tax receipts benefited from better-than-expected profitability, slower
import growth led to underperformance in import VAT collections. Fuel levy receipts
contracted amid falling demand and large diesel refund payments. Import VAT collections
fell by more than 20 per cent between 2022/23 and 2023/24 as nominal imports slowed
sharply. While this trend has since moderated, tax receipts contracted by 1 per cent in the
first 11 months of 2024/25 compared with the same period in the previous year.

Stable power supply led to lower imports of energy-related components, which alongside
weaker investment subdued demand for imports. Despite domestic VAT performing better
than expected, the contraction in import VAT led to significant downward revisions to net
VAT collections compared with 2024 Budget estimates.

Similarly, demand for fuel fell sharply during 2024/25, and fuel levy collections declined by
6.5 per cent over the first 11 months of the year. Volumes of domestic and imported diesel
contracted as load-shedding subsided. Significant diesel refund claims will be settled by
the end of 2024/25, further reducing fuel levy collections.
In contrast, corporate tax collections are expected to outperform 2024 Budget estimates.
Although provisional corporate tax collections from the mining sector contracted by
28 per cent during 2024/25, this was offset by profits in other sectors.
Personal income tax collection grew at 12.6 per cent over the first 11 months of 2024/25
compared with the same period in the prior year. This reflects the impact of tax policy
measures announced in the 2024 Budget and larger-than-expected tax receipts from
withdrawals once the two-pot retirement reform came into effect on 1 September 2024.

Outcome Medium-term estimates
CHAPTER 4
REVENUE TRENDS AND TAX PROPOSALS
36 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Overall, personal income tax collections are revised down relative to 2024 Budget
estimates, in line with a weaker outlook for employee compensation in 2024/25.
Medium-term revenue outlook
The medium-term revenue outlook is revised up by R137.8 billion relative to the
2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. As shown in Table 4.3, the increases in the
VAT rate in 2025/26 and 2026/27 are expected to contribute significantly to additional
revenue collection. There is an improved outlook for employee compensation in 2025/26
which, alongside additional revenue expected from not adjusting personal income tax
brackets for inflation and two-pot savings component withdrawals, will support stronger
personal income tax collections.
The buoyancy of tax revenue for a given level of economic growth is expected to be higher
over the medium term, mainly due to the policy measures implemented from 2025/26 and
higher personal income tax collections.
The tax-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach 25.4 per cent by 2027/28, supported by an
improved economic outlook. Gross tax revenue collections are expected to increase by
8.7 per cent in 2025/26, 7.8 per cent in 2026/27 and 6.6 per cent in 2027/28. This
translates into gross tax revenue increasing from an expected R1.85 trillion in 2024/25 to
R2.31 trillion in 2027/28. Higher revenue collection requires sustained investment and
economic growth, supported by continued improvements in tax administration.
TAX POLICY
A broad tax base, combined with relatively low tax rates and improved tax administration,
supports sustainable revenue-raising and economic growth over the long term. A tax rate
increase has, however, become unavoidable to ensure adequate funding for policy
priorities while maintaining fiscal sustainability.
Increasing tax rates affects the economy, the behavioural response of taxpayers, and
considerations of inequality and fairness. In balancing these considerations, government
aims for a tax policy mix that generates sufficient revenue while promoting economic
growth, efficiency and transparency, with careful consideration of the relative economic
and distributional impact of different taxes.
During 2024, two longer-term policy reforms came into effect: the global minimum tax and
the two-pot retirement reform. The global minimum tax is expected to increase the
amount of corporate tax collected over time. It requires large domestic and foreign
multinationals operating in South Africa, as well as South African multinationals in other
jurisdictions, to pay more corporate income tax to SARS from 2026/27 if their effective tax
rate is below 15 per cent. The two-pot retirement reform has alleviated some near-term
revenue pressure through larger-than-expected tax receipts from withdrawals, even
though that was not the policy focus of the reform.
CHAPTER 4
REVENUE TRENDS AND TAX PROPOSALS
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 37
Tax administration update
Over the past five years, SARS has made significant progress in rebuilding and modernising
its systems by shifting to online services and automating many of its processes to improve
service, detect fraud and enhance compliance. In 2025/26, SARS will focus on addressing
the tax gap to improve revenue collection. This will be done by improving taxpayer
compliance and trade facilitation by leveraging artificial intelligence and data science.
SARS is deploying technologies to simplify its processes and enhance the single window
platform to improve taxpayer and trader service. Adopting scanning technologies and
intelligent image analysis will significantly reduce inspection times through ports of entry.
The traveller declaration system is being modernised to provide digital services to crossborder travellers and state entities, reducing illicit financial flows and other risks.
TAX PROPOSALS
The 2025 Budget tax proposals are designed to increase revenue collection. In addition,
guidance is provided on the future of the carbon tax.
Revenue measures are expected to raise R28 billion in 2025/26 and R14.5 billion in
2026/27, adding significantly to tax collections over the medium term. The largest
contribution over the medium term is from the increases in the VAT rate, while personal
income tax is increased in 2025/26 by not adjusting the tax brackets, rebates and medical
tax credits for inflation. To mitigate the impact of these increases on households, the
basket of VAT zero-rated foodstuffs will be expanded and the general fuel levy will not be
increased. Excise duties on alcohol and tobacco products will be adjusted above the
expected inflation rate.
Two-pot retirement reform
The two-pot retirement reform took effect on 1 September 2024. This reform was described
extensively in Chapter 4 of the 2024 Budget Review. One-third of retirement fund
contributions now go into a “savings component”, while two-thirds go into a “retirement
component”. Retirement fund members can make one withdrawal per tax year from the
savings component. Pre-retirement withdrawals from the savings component are taxable at
marginal tax rates, like all other income.
To date, the revenue collected from the savings component withdrawals has surpassed the
initial estimate of R5 billion for 2024/25, with tax collections amounting to R11.6 billion as of
end-February 2025. Withdrawals are expected to continue into the medium term as fund
members access their savings component.

Increasing the VAT rate
The first 0.5 percentage point increase in the VAT rate will take effect on 1 May 2025 and
the second 0.5 percentage point increase will take effect on 1 April 2026. In making this
decision, government carefully considered the potential contributions of each of the main
tax instruments. VAT is an efficient source of revenue. It is broad based, and its design is
simple with minimal exceptions. Moreover, South Africa’s VAT rate is still relatively low
compared with peer countries (Figure 4.1).

VAT is a tax on consumption. A rate increase affects all households through price increases,
but most VAT is paid by higher-income households, which consume more. Over
75 per cent of VAT revenue is derived from households in the top four expenditure deciles,
which roughly corresponds to households that spend R118 000 or more per year
(Figure 4.2).

Increasing taxes on consumption through a higher VAT rate will have the least detrimental
effect on economic growth and employment over the medium term, relative to increases
in personal or corporate income tax rates.
Raising personal income tax rates is likely to be inefficient as taxpayers make adjustments
to reduce their tax liabilities. Higher personal income tax rates would also reduce the
incentive to work and save, with potentially larger negative impacts on the economy. Over
the past decade, several measures have been implemented to raise personal income taxes.
While these have increased the tax burden on individuals, the tax rate increases generated
less revenue than expected. South Africa’s personal income tax collection measured as a
contribution to GDP, and the top tax rate, are far higher than those of most developing
countries (Figure 4.3). For these reasons, the personal income tax rates have not been
increased, although additional revenue is generated by not adjusting the tax brackets and
rebates for inflation.

REVENUE TRENDS AND TAX PROPOSALS
40 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Increases in the corporate tax rate are likely to impede competitiveness while generating
less revenue than VAT. Corporate taxes make a higher contribution as a percentage of GDP
in South Africa than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and
African averages (Figure 4.4). Of 123 reporting countries, South Africa ranks 13th for
corporate tax as a share of GDP. These collections are also more volatile as they depend
heavily on commodity price cycles and economic growth. Corporate income tax revenues
are expected to increase over time due to the introduction of the Global Minimum Tax
Act (2024), which will raise revenue and reduce the incentive for large firms to shift profits.
Consideration of further VAT zero rating
The VAT system currently zero rates 21 essential food items in an effort to make them
more affordable for lower-income households. Government proposes to extend the list of
zero-rated basic foods to mitigate the effect of the VAT rate increases. From 1 May 2025,
zero rating will be extended to include edible offal of sheep, poultry, goats, swine and
bovine animals; specific cuts such as heads, feet, bones and tongues; dairy liquid blend;
and tinned or canned vegetables.
This decision considered the risk of tax base erosion and the distributional impact of the
items identified. Zero rating is a blunt tool to assist lower-income households, because
there is no guarantee that there will be a reduction in prices. Zero rating that is not well
targeted results in a large portion of the revenue forgone benefiting higher-income
households. Nonetheless, the 2022/23 Income and Expenditure Survey shows high
consumption of the proposed additional items in the lowest four expenditure deciles. It is
estimated that these measures will cost government about R2 billion in forgone revenue.
Personal income tax
Personal income tax brackets and rebates will not be adjusted for inflation in 2025/26. The
personal income tax proposals are effective from 1 March 2025 and expected to raise
revenue of R19.5 billion. No changes to medical tax credits are proposed – these will
remain at R364 per month for the first two beneficiaries and at R246 per month for the
remaining beneficiaries.
Figure 4.5 shows the distribution of medical tax credit costs by taxable income. The total
medical tax credit cost for those with taxable incomes above R1 million is R3.1 billion.

Adjustment of transfer duty
As part of the periodic reviews of monetary values in tax tables, the monetary thresholds
for transfer duties will be adjusted by 10 per cent to compensate for inflation. The transfer
duty tax rates will remain unchanged. Table 4.6 indicates the adjusted values and is
proposed to become effective on 1 April 2025.

REVENUE TRENDS AND TAX PROPOSALS
42 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Employment tax incentive values
Government proposes to maintain the value of the employment tax incentive at a
maximum of R1 500 per month in the first 12 months and R750 per month in the second
12 months of eligibility. Effective from 1 April 2025, the formula to calculate the incentive
and the eligible income bands will be adjusted, in part due to adjustments of minimum
wages since the last increase in the value of the incentive in 2022. Employers will be able
to claim the incentive at a rate of 60 per cent of the wages below R2 500 per month, where
such wage minimums are allowed due to existing exemptions. The maximum value of
R1 500 per month will apply to employees earning between R2 500 and R5 500 monthly,
up from R2 000 and R4 500 previously. The incentive value will decline as wages increase,
tapering to zero at a monthly income of R7 500 (previously R6 500).
Extending the urban development zone tax incentive
The urban development zone tax incentive was introduced in 2003 to address urban decay
within inner cities. To allow for certainty and planning for investors, and adequate time to
consult with municipalities, it is proposed that the sunset date for this incentive be
extended by five years to 31 March 2030.
Review of the renewable energy allowance
In 2023, government introduced a new temporary incentive for renewable energy. The
temporary incentive fell away on 28 February 2025. The 2024 Budget Review noted that
government would reconsider the leasing provisions and the generation threshold of
1 megawatt (MW) under the original incentive (12B). After careful assessment, it is
proposed that these two design features remain unchanged.
Cross-border tax treatment of retirement funds
The current treatment of cross-border retirement funds may result in double non-taxation,
particularly where South Africa is granted the taxing right by treaty. It is proposed that
changes be made to the rules that currently exempt lump sums, pensions and annuities

received by South African residents from foreign retirement funds for previous
employment outside South Africa, with amendments in the current legislative cycle.
Excise duties on alcoholic beverages and tobacco-related products
Government published a discussion paper, The Taxation of Alcoholic Beverages, for public
comment on 13 November 2024. It proposes adjustments to the alcohol excise taxation
policy framework, including the introduction of a three-tier progressive excise duty rate
structure for wine and beer. Government will hold public consultations on the new excise
framework during 2025. Considering that the details of the new alcohol excise taxation
framework will be finalised only after the 2025 Budget, government proposes to increase
excise duties on alcoholic beverages by 6.75 per cent for 2025/26.
The guideline excise tax burden as a percentage of the retail selling price of the most
popular brand within each tobacco product category is currently 40 per cent. Government
proposes to increase tobacco excise duties by 4.75 per cent for cigarettes, cigarette
tobacco, and electronic nicotine and non-nicotine delivery systems (“vaping”). The
proposed increase for pipe tobacco and cigars is 6.75 per cent.
To ease the administrative burden of implementing adjustments on Budget Day, in future
years adjustments to excise duties will take effect from 1 April. Legislative provisions to
deal with unusual clearances of cigarettes around Budget announcements have been in
place since 2021 and may be extended.

Carbon tax
The carbon tax plays an integral role in South Africa’s climate change mitigation efforts. It
increased from R190 to R236 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) from
1 January 2025. From 2 April 2025, the carbon fuel levy will increase by 3c/litre to 14c/litre
for petrol and 17c/litre for diesel, as required under the Carbon Tax Act (2019). The carbon
tax cost recovery quantum for the liquid fuels sector increased from 0.69c/litre to
0.99c/litre from 1 January 2025 to align with the increase of the headline carbon tax rate.
Carbon tax proposals
In November 2024, government published a discussion paper on phase 2 of the carbon tax
for public comment. The paper set out proposals to reduce some of the tax-free allowances
and strengthen the effective carbon tax rate to promote behaviour change. After considering
stakeholder comments, the main proposals for the carbon tax are to:
• Extend the section 12L energy-efficiency tax incentive for five years to
31 December 2030.
• Extend the commitment to electricity price neutrality to 31 December 2030. This fiveyear extension will continue to protect consumers from higher electricity prices. This will
be achieved by removing the electricity generation levy from 1 January 2026 and
applying the carbon tax on electricity emissions. Electricity generators can continue to
deduct a portion of the renewable energy premium from their carbon tax liability to the
extent that there would have been a difference between the carbon tax and electricity
levy. The carbon tax on electricity generation will be revenue neutral.
• Increase the carbon offset allowance by 5 percentage points from 1 January 2026. The
allowance will increase to 10 per cent for fugitive and process emissions, and to
15 per cent for combustion emissions. Future allowance increases may be considered in
response to changes in the carbon market and associated standards.
• Retain the 30 per cent trade-intensity threshold used to determine the trade exposure
allowance that a sector or company will qualify for. The discussion paper proposed to
increase the threshold from 30 to 50 per cent, but stakeholders raised concerns about
the effects on competitiveness. The current threshold will be retained to allow a longer
transitional period for hard-to-abate sectors.
• Maintain the basic tax-free allowance until 31 December 2030. The discussion paper
proposed to reduce this allowance from 2027. Given concerns about the availability of
low-carbon technologies, energy costs, competition, load-shedding and logistical
challenges, the National Treasury will consult with the Department of Forestry, Fisheries
and the Environment, the Presidential Climate Commission and others on options to
reduce the basic tax-free allowance from 1 January 2031.
• Extend the carbon budget allowance for the voluntary carbon budget system until
31 December 2025.
• Introduce a greenhouse gas emission intensity benchmark of 0.94 tCO2e/MWh for the
electricity sector from 1 January 2026. Under the carbon tax, companies may qualify for
a performance allowance if they outperform an approved sector intensity benchmark,
which does not yet exist in the electricity sector. After further consultations the
regulations will be amended and published for public comment.
• Extend the utilisation period for carbon offsets generated from projects approved before
the introduction of the carbon tax until 31 December 2028.
CHAPTER 4
REVENUE TRENDS AND TAX PROPOSALS
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 45
Health promotion levy
An inflationary increase in the health promotion levy was due to take effect from 1 April
2025. Government proposes to cancel this increase to allow the sugar industry more time
to restructure in response to regional competition.
Ad valorem excise duties on smartphones
Currently, ad valorem excise duties on smartphones are charged at a flat rate of 9 per cent.
To enhance smartphone affordability at the lower end of the price spectrum and support
efforts to promote digital inclusion for low-income households, government proposes that
as of 1 April 2025 this duty rate be applied only to smartphones with a price paid greater
than R2 500 at the time of export to South Africa.
Fuel taxes and levies
To mitigate the effects of higher inflation arising from fuel price increases, the general fuel
levy has remained unchanged since 2022. Government proposes to keep the general fuel
levy unchanged for 2025/26, resulting in tax relief of about R4 billion. The Road Accident
Fund (RAF) levy and the customs and excise levy will also remain unchanged.
Adjustment to the diesel refund for the primary sector
To support South Africa’s international competitiveness, tax regulations enable farming,
mining and forestry businesses to qualify for a refund of the general fuel levy and RAF levy
for 80 per cent of eligible diesel fuel purchases. Government proposes to align with the
original policy intent and apply the refund for all eligible diesel purchases declared to SARS,
effective from 1 April 2026. The proposal will simplify the administration of the diesel
refund system, costing the fiscus an estimated R1 billion from 2026/27.

Other matters under consideration and consultation
• A discussion paper on collective investment scheme (CIS) taxation made three main
proposals: make CIS fully tax transparent, provide a threshold for CIS and remove
hedge funds from the framework. Government acknowledges the administrative
concerns raised with respect to the fully tax-transparent proposal and confirms that
it does not intend to tax all CIS returns as revenue. Consultations will continue in 2025.
• Government intends to publish a consultation paper on unlocking institutional
funding for infrastructure. It will propose that certain investment vehicles be enabled
to facilitate such investments and would offer a flow-through tax regime. Further
consultations will take place during 2025.
• Government aims to expand South Africa’s tax treaty network and renegotiate some
existing treaties to strengthen economic and trade relations, prevent double taxation
and tax abuse, and enhance regional cooperation.
• The VAT Act (1991) provides for a VAT exemption on the importation of certain lowvalue goods. Government will review legislation to bring parity to the VAT treatment
of such goods purchased online, as many offshore suppliers of these goods are not
registered for VAT.
CONCLUSION
The 2025 Budget introduces measures to increase revenue and promote fiscal
sustainability. Government remains committed to maintaining a progressive, stable and
transparent tax system that is supported by an effective tax administration.

CHAPTER 5
CONSOLIDATED SPENDING PLANS
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 47
In brief
• Consolidated government spending increases at an annual average of 5.6 per cent, from
R2.4 trillion in 2024/25 to R2.83 trillion in 2027/28.
• Over the medium term, economic development is the fastest-growing function at an
annual average rate of 8.1 per cent, driven by higher allocations to infrastructure
projects.
• Spending is highly redistributive, with the social wage making up 61 per cent of total
consolidated non-interest spending over the next three years.
• The 2025 Budget funds spending pressures of R232.6 billion over the medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) period, including provisional allocations for frontline
service delivery departments amounting to R70.7 billion.
• Additional funding of R46.7 billion is made available for infrastructure investments and
R23.4 billion is made available for the 2025 public-service wage agreement, which
provides greater certainty for budget planning for the next three years.
OVERVIEW
The 2025 Budget outlines medium-term spending plans and ensures government can meet
its fiscal goals. Consolidated government spending is projected to increase from
R2.4 trillion in 2024/25 to R2.83 trillion in 2027/28. In real terms, consolidated spending
grows by 1.1 per cent over the medium term. South Africa needs to get better value for
money from this large budget.
Government spending remains highly redistributive, with a majority of the budget
allocated to the social wage – spending on health, education, social protection, community
development and employment programmes.

CONSOLIDATED SPENDING PLANS
48 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The 2025 Budget also includes provisional allocations that will be made available to
departments during 2025/26 and over the medium term once certain conditions are met,
and departmental plans and programmes are updated.
REVISIONS TO SPENDING PLANS
The 2025 Budget funds spending pressures of R232.6 billion over the MTEF period. These
spending additions are partially offset by drawdowns on provisional allocations and
contingency reserves, resulting in a net increase in non-interest expenditure of
R142 billion. The main spending additions are for critical infrastructure investments, social
protection and a higher-than-anticipated public-service wage agreement, alongside
provisional allocations for critical frontline services.
After the approval of the 2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS),
provisional allocations were increased by R70.7 billion. These amounts are provisionally
allocated mainly for goods and services and compensation of employees in critical
frontline services. This funding will address significant pressures in provincial health and
education, expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood development,
support the employment of doctors after their community service ends, increase the
availability of medicines and medical supplies, and strengthen capacity within the Border
Management Authority.
Government remains committed to improving performance and efficiency in the public
service. Access to funding to address compensation shortfalls will be linked to participation
in the early retirement initiative, which is allocated R4.4 billion in 2025/26 and R6.6 billion
in 2026/27. These amounts are set aside for departments to access during each financial
year if they meet the relevant requirements, such as the minimum age of each applicant
and confirmation that each application has been approved by the relevant executive
authority. Departments will be allowed to retain their savings from this initiative, and may
use them to address existing compensation pressures and support capacity building.
The 2025 Budget directs resources to growth-enhancing activities, particularly
infrastructure, and advances regulatory reforms to support investment spending. It
allocates an additional R46.7 billion for critical infrastructure projects. This includes
support for projects approved as part of the Budget Facility for Infrastructure and
investments in passenger rail transport to modernise signalling technology systems that
will improve service frequency, safety and efficiency. As outlined in Chapter 6, the budget
also aims to reverse declining water, electricity and solid waste services in cities through
R8.5 billion earmarked for the turnaround of these entities. Finally, funding for disaster
response will be supported by reforms to address inefficiencies in disaster management
funding through a review of the conditional grants system.
In summary, the main proposed spending additions over the medium term include:
• R46.7 billion for infrastructure investments.

PROVISIONAL ALLOCATIONS
As reflected in Table 5.2, a portion of additions to planned spending is in the form of
provisional allocations. These are funds that, though set aside for a specific purpose, will
only be made available to departments when they demonstrate readiness or meet specific
conditions. For example, provisional allocations to address compensation shortfalls in the
departments of Defence and Correctional Services will be appropriated to these
departments once the extent of their participation in the early retirement programme is
clarified.
In this regard, the 2025 Budget includes provisional allocations not appropriated to votes
of R37.1 billion in 2025/26, R83 billion in 2026/27 and R84.7 billion in 2027/28. These cover
a wide range of critical services and other priorities, as shown in Table 5.3.
CONSOLIDATED GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE
Table 5.4 outlines spending plans by function, debt-service costs and the contingency
reserve. Total consolidated government spending is expected to grow at an average
annual rate of 5.6 per cent, from R2.4 trillion in 2024/25 to R2.83 trillion in 2027/28.
The Budget includes once-off support for the G20 hosting requirements. South Africa’s
G20 Presidency in 2025 seeks to enhance solidarity through unified effort and cooperation
among nations, and to promote equality through the fair treatment and advancement of
all people.

Debt-service costs are higher than estimated in the 2024 MTBPS due to the annual budget
deficit, elevated interest rates and a weaker exchange rate. Over the MTEF period,
government will spend more on debt-service costs than on health, basic education or
social development.
From the perspective of economic classification, Table 5.5 shows that current payments
constitute the largest share of the budget, driven mainly by compensation of employees,
which makes up 31.9 per cent of total spending. Transfers and subsidies grow at an annual

average rate of 4.4 per cent. Payments for capital assets are the fastest-growing item, at
8.1 per cent annually, mainly because of infrastructure allocations for transport and water
projects.
SPENDING PRIORITIES BY FUNCTION
Spending across functions supports the implementation of policy priorities. Learning and
culture receives 23.8 per cent (R1.61 trillion) of the total budget for functions, while the
general public services function receives the smallest share at 3.6 per cent (R243.9 billion).

Learning and culture
Spending in this function group is dominated by employee compensation in provincial
education departments, which accounts for 52.1 per cent of total function group spending
and 78 per cent of provincial education budgets. Mother tongue-based bilingual education
and early grade reading are key focus areas for the basic education sector, with R99 million
redirected over the MTEF period to support teacher training, the development of new
teaching and learning resources, and the monitoring of these strategies.
Additionally, to extend early childhood development (ECD) coverage, R210 million has
been reprioritised in 2026/27 and 2027/28 to upgrade and construct ECD centres. Two
school infrastructure projects recommended by the Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI)
in Gauteng and the Western Cape are included in the education infrastructure grant. The
department will submit a sector request to the BFI to meet infrastructure needs in the
other provinces. Provincial education departments will continue to prioritise improving
educational outcomes by providing learning materials, enhancing school infrastructure,
allocating funds to schools and developing teachers.
Meanwhile, the Department of Higher Education is implementing a pilot student funding
model for the “missing middle”, which refers to students from families with annual
incomes ranging from R350 000 to R600 000. The National Student Financial Aid Scheme
will manage these loans using funds provided by the National Skills Fund, amounting to
R1.5 billion in 2024/25 and R3 billion over the MTEF period.
The apprenticeship and skills development levy systems will be reviewed. The goal, in
collaboration with the private sector, is to double the number of artisans completing trade
tests in the next three years through increased work-based learning opportunities.
The arts, culture, sport and recreation sector is allocated R38.4 billion over the medium
term to support school sports, national recreation events and selected sporting codes, as
well as to preserve and promote the cultural, heritage and linguistic diversity of South
Africa.

Health
The health function is allocated R941.5 billion over the MTEF period to support the
equitable provision of public health services, including free primary healthcare. About
44.7 per cent of this allocation is directed to funding district health services, particularly
primary healthcare facilities such as clinics and community health centres, which also
provide outreach services. This level of care is recognised as the most efficient and
effective due to its focus on disease prevention and proximity to communities. Almost
98 per cent of the budget for this function is allocated to provinces, amounting to about
R922.7 billion. Employee compensation accounts for 64.1 per cent of the provincial total.
To maintain an adequate number of healthcare personnel, especially doctors and nurses,

the sector plans to focus on stricter enforcement of existing policies such as overtime work
and remuneration for work performed outside the public sector.
As part of strengthening the health system and preparing for the national health insurance
(NHI) policy, the Department of Health will fund the development of a patient information
system, a centralised chronic medicine dispensing and distribution system, and a facility
medicine stock surveillance system. Over the MTEF period, the indirect and direct
conditional grants for NHI are allocated R8.5 billion and R1.4 billion respectively.
Sustained allocations for direct and indirect infrastructure grants, including potential
additional funding through the BFI, as outlined in the 2024 MTBPS, will focus on new or
replacement buildings, upgrades, rehabilitation and maintenance. The total infrastructure
allocation is R37.4 billion over the MTEF period, including provisional allocations from the
BFI and new allocations for Siloam District Hospital and Tygerberg Hospital equipment
through a public-private partnership in 2027/28. It remains important to improve
efficiency in expenditure, including in the areas of commuted overtime, public
procurement and price benchmarking.
Social development
The social development function is allocated R422.3 billion in 2025/26, which increases to
R452.7 billion in 2027/28 at an average annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent. This funding
supports poverty reduction through social grants, the provision of risk benefits through
social insurance and the delivery of welfare services, development initiatives,

empowerment programmes, gender equality initiatives and advocacy for children,
women, youth, the elderly and individuals with disabilities.
Social grant spending makes up 81 per cent of the allocation for this function. At an
average annual growth rate of 5.3 per cent, social protection spending increases above
inflation over the medium term; however, social grant reform and efficiency savings will
be necessary to ensure the sustainability of the social security system. The number of
social grant beneficiaries, excluding the COVID-19 social relief of distress grant, is expected
to rise from 19 million in 2025/26 to 19.3 million in 2027/28, primarily due to the growing
population of older people. Therefore, the sector’s operational budget will be subject to
conditions, including the need to improve biometric verification of recipients to achieve
savings.
The budget for social grants is increased by R8.2 billion over the medium term to account
for higher costs of living. In April 2025, the old age grant, war veterans grant, disability
grant and care dependency grant will each increase by R130. The foster care grant will

increase by R70 in April to R1 250. The child support grant and grant-in-aid grant will both
rise by R30 in April to R560.
The COVID-19 social relief of distress grant will be extended by another year until
31 March 2026. An amount of R35.2 billion is allocated to extend the payment at the
current R370 per month per beneficiary, including administration costs.

The Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities is allocated an additional
R71.7 million over the MTEF period for operations and public-service wage increases, and
to lead the Women Empowerment Working Group of the G20. The National Youth
Development Agency has been allocated R549.8 million for the national youth service
programme over the same period.
Community development
Spending in the community development function is expected to increase by an average
of 4.5 per cent annually over the medium term due to growth in the local government
equitable share and allocations for infrastructure. Priorities include improving responses
to disasters, increased oversight over local government, investments in public transport,
affordable housing, implementation of the Integrated National Electrification Programme,
supporting just energy transition measures, and continuing to invest in water, sanitation
and other infrastructure through conditional grants.
To support infrastructure development, R885.7 billion is allocated. This will be
concentrated on supporting the recovery of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa,
improving the financial viability of trading entities, bulk infrastructure maintenance and
development at the municipal level, post-disaster infrastructure recovery investments and
expanding electricity transmission lines through the National Transmission Company of
South Africa.

Economic development
Medium-term spending for economic development will primarily focus on economic
regulation and infrastructure, with average growth of 8.1 per cent from R252.4 billion in
2024/25 to R318.4 billion in 2027/28.
Over the medium term, the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation will invest
R3 billion in construction of the MeerKAT array and efforts to secure the hosting of part of
the Square Kilometre Array. Guided by evidence and targeted public policy interventions,
R2.9 billion will be invested annually in postgraduate development and research support.
Additionally, R3.8 billion will be allocated annually to provide access to cutting-edge
research infrastructure.
To enhance productivity, competitiveness and the green economy, government will spend
R18.4 billion over the medium term to support businesses through various incentive
programmes under the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition. These
programmes include the automotive investment scheme, business process outsourcing,
film and television production incentives, special economic zones, clothing and textile
competitiveness programmes, the industrial park revitalisation programme and industrial
development support for electric vehicle production.
The Department of Small Business Development is allocated R2.1 billion over the medium
term to support about 120 000 competitive small businesses, particularly those owned by
women, youth and persons with disabilities in marginalised areas such as townships and
rural regions. In addition, government has allocated R313.7 million over the medium term
for the establishment of micro, small and medium enterprise hubs to support business
expansion.

Government will merge the comprehensive agricultural support programme grant and the
Ilima/Letsema projects grant into a single grant with the existing consolidated baseline of
R7.3 billion over the MTEF period. This merger aims to streamline grant administration,
improve resource allocation, and support commercial and subsistence farming. To
minimise outbreaks of pests and diseases that affect agricultural production, the
department will accelerate regulatory compliance and monitoring interventions costing
R30.3 million over the medium term.
The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa is allocated R102 million in
2025/26 for the second phase of the licensing of spectrum through an auction process.
This is expected to increase investment in networks, improve network quality, contribute
to economic growth and lower data costs.
The Department of Land Reform and Rural Development will expedite the finalisation of
outstanding land claims, prioritising older claims. Over the medium term, R11.6 billion is
allocated to settle about 844 land restitution claims, with R3 billion earmarked to allocate
138 000 hectares of land.

This function aims to establish a capable developmental state by promoting safer
communities, boosting business confidence, managing borders effectively and supporting
development. The budget for the function grows by 4.7 per cent annually, from
R250.4 billion in 2024/25 to R287 billion in 2027/28. This increase is primarily to fund
SANDF troop deployment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, enhance capacity in
the judiciary and prepare for the 2026 local government elections.
Over the medium term, R119.1 million has been reprioritised within this function to help
establish a shared forensic capability at the Financial Intelligence Centre. Moreover,
R150 million will be reprioritised to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation over
the next two years to improve forensic accounting services as part of an initiative to bolster
efforts to combat complex financial crimes and corruption. The total cost of R300 million
over 30 months will be equally shared between the directorate and the private sector,
fostering a collaborative approach to tackling economic crimes. These allocations will help
combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, in line with recommendations
from the Financial Action Task Force and the State Capture Commission.
An allocation of R821.2 million over the medium term is designated for the Office of the
Chief Justice to enhance capacity, address the funding shortfall for employee
compensation and cover operational costs. This funding will also support the development
of an online court system to improve judicial efficiency and enhance access to justice.
To support the smooth conduct of the 2026 local government elections, R1.4 billion is
allocated for 2026/27. Of this funding, R885 million will be directed to the Independent
Electoral Commission to oversee and manage the electoral process. Additionally,
R400 million will be allocated to the South African Police Service to ensure public safety
and maintain order during the elections, while R150 million will go to the Department of
Defence for logistical and security support.

As part of initiatives to strengthen border security and improve the management of ports
of entry, R909 million has been reallocated over the next three years from the Department
of Public Works and Infrastructure to the Border Management Authority under the
Department of Home Affairs. This funding will enhance the management of infrastructure
at ports of entry.
General public services
The general public services function focuses on building a capable, ethical and
developmental state that delivers services to all citizens. Over the medium term, the
budget grows by an average of 3 per cent annually.
At the time of the 2024 MTBPS, the South African Revenue Service was allocated
R3.5 billion over the medium term to modernise its operations and enhance taxpayer
services. The focus is on leveraging technology, data science and artificial intelligence to
foster efficiency and transparency in tax administration while combating exploitation by
criminal syndicates.
The National Treasury is allocated R5.3 billion over the MTEF period for international
institutions and agreements, including the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative,
the Monetary Common Area and the International Monetary Fund’s Regional Technical
Assistance Centre for Southern Africa. The Department of International Relations and
Cooperation also receives funding to further the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the
United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Medical benefits expenditure for former government employees is projected to rise from
R5.4 billion in 2024/25 to R7.6 billion in 2027/28, growing at 12 per cent per year. This rise
is mainly driven by increased premiums and a growing number of retired employees. An
additional R2.7 billion will be allocated to account for expected premium increases and
membership growth.
The abolition of the Department of Public Enterprises and transfer of functions to other
ministries created savings of R151.4 million, most of which will be used to enhance public

administration and modernise information and communications technology in the
Presidency. The Department of Public Service and Administration is allocated R82.6 million
over the medium term to implement measures to combat corruption, such as enforcing
codes of conduct, providing protection to whistleblowers and conducting lifestyle audits
for state employees.
CONCLUSION
Over the medium term, consolidated expenditure grows at an annual average of
5.6 per cent. Government spending continues to prioritise the social wage, focusing on
critical areas such as health, education, social protection, community development and
employment programmes. The 2025 Budget enables government to add funding for
essential services, meet the demands of rising public-service wage obligations and drive
significantly higher infrastructure investment.

DIVISION OF REVENUE AND SPENDING
BY PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 63
In brief
• The division of revenue makes R2.95 trillion available to provinces and municipalities
over the medium term.
• Significant reforms are under way to improve provincial and municipal performance.
• Provinces need to improve the management of personnel costs, raise infrastructure
investment and arrest the trend of rising accruals in the health and education sectors.
• Municipalities face governance, accountability and capacity challenges, with persistent
irregular expenditure, rising debt accruals and declining revenue generation.
• Additional provision for disaster risk financing reforms aim to enhance resilience.
• Conditional grant reforms focus on streamlining, enhancing flexibility and aligning
resources with service delivery priorities.
OVERVIEW
This chapter focuses on developments in provinces and municipalities – particularly the
structural reforms under way to address persistent financial, accountability and service
delivery problems, which include significant fiscal difficulties.
Municipalities are grappling with weak revenue generation as property tax and service
charge collections decline in real terms. There is a growing reliance on intergovernmental
transfers, which now account for over 70 per cent of municipal budgets in many cases.
Urban municipalities are more resilient due to diversified revenue streams, but rural
municipalities remain heavily dependent on transfers, exacerbating inequities in
development and service delivery.
Provinces face similar fiscal pressures, with personnel costs – particularly in education and
health – consuming over 70 per cent of budgets in some cases. Underspending on capital
projects due to weak capacity and procurement further hampers service delivery.
Government is implementing a range of reforms to support resilience and disaster
management, increase the financing and delivery of infrastructure, and improve the
delivery of services. A new performance-based grant has also been established that will
reward improvements in the institutional capability, financial sustainability and
operational performance of metro trading services such as water and sanitation.
Subnational governments need to implement structural reforms to improve spending
efficiency, enhance revenue management and enforce accountability. Strategic planning
and robust financial management are essential to ensure sustainable service delivery and
reduce disparities between urban and rural areas.
DIVISION OF REVENUE
For the 2025 medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) period, provinces and
municipalities are allocated R2.95 trillion or 49.8 per cent of total non-interest spending.
Of this amount, R2.4 trillion goes to provinces and local government receives
R552.7 billion. Funds are allocated in the form of equitable shares, which are distributed
CHAPTER 6

BY PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES
64 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
through a formula that factors in demographic and developmental considerations, and
conditional grants. Conditional grants are designed to achieve specific objectives, and they
are made available once provinces and municipalities fulfil conditions relating to their use.
Provinces and municipalities face spending and revenue pressures from the rising costs of
basic and social services, as well as declining economic growth and high borrowing costs.
Table 6.1 sets out the division of revenue over the MTEF period. After providing for debtservice costs, the contingency reserve and provisional allocations, 48.4 per cent of
nationally raised funds are allocated to national government, 41.9 per cent to provincial
government and 9.7 per cent to local government.
The Explanatory Memorandum to the Division of Revenue sets out the provincial and
municipal allocations, details the equitable share formula and explains how the division
takes into account the recommendations of the Financial and Fiscal Commission. The
memorandum is available as Annexure W1 of the Budget Review on the National Treasury
website.

PROVINCIAL REVENUE AND SPENDING
Provinces are responsible for providing social services according to nationally determined
norms and standards, including basic education for 13.5 million learners and healthcare
for 53.2 million people without private medical insurance. In 2023/24, transfers through
the division of revenue accounted for about 97 per cent of provincial revenue. The rest is
composed of legislatively limited own-revenue collections, which are estimated to amount
to R84.1 billion over the MTEF period, mainly from motor vehicle licence fees.
Direct national transfers to provinces are projected to grow from R730.7 billion in 2024/25
at an average annual rate of 4.5 per cent to reach R833.8 billion in 2027/28. The transfers
include R633.2 billion for the provincial equitable share and R134.6 billion for conditional
grants in 2025/26. Within conditional grants, R94 million is reprioritised over the MTEF
period from the provincial roads maintenance grant to fund other transport priorities. To
help implement the 2025 public-service wage agreement, provinces are allocated an
additional R4.8 billion in 2025/26, R5.2 billion in 2026/27 and R5.4 billion in 2027/28.
PROVISIONAL ALLOCATIONS
The Budget includes provisional allocations that will be made available to provinces during
2025/26 and over the medium term, subject to the fulfilment of specific conditions or the
completion of outstanding planning and administrative processes.
A total of R29 billion is provisionally allocated to provincial education departments for
compensation costs and the expansion of early childhood development services. Of this
amount, R9.9 billion is earmarked for the early childhood development grant, and the
remaining funds will flow through the provincial equitable share. In addition, R28.9 billion
has been provisionally allocated to the health sector. Of this, R16.3 billion is set aside for
compensation costs in provincial health departments and will be distributed through the
provincial equitable share.

Review of the education component of the provincial equitable share formula
The provincial equitable share is the main revenue source for provinces, comprising six key
components: education, health, basic, institutional, poverty and economic activity. It is
updated annually to ensure fair allocation based on demographic shifts and service delivery
needs.
The review of the education component has been finalised and endorsed by the Department
of Basic Education. Proposed reforms include incorporating learners with special needs into
enrolment numbers and restructuring the enrolment subcomponent to differentiate among
learners. This redesign assigns greater weight to learners from poorer backgrounds compared
to those who are better off. However, implementation of these reforms has been deferred to
the 2026 MTEF period due to the unavailability of updated Income and Expenditure Survey
data from Statistics South Africa at the level required to revise the quintile table used for
categorising learners.

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 67
While there are indications that provinces are tightening financial controls, further
improvements are needed. Irregular expenditure declined notably from R55 billion in
2022/23 to R20.7 billion in 2023/24. Unauthorised expenditure also decreased, from
R3.1 billion in 2022/23 to R2.2 billion in 2023/24, while fruitless and wasteful expenditure
fell from R626.6 million in 2022/23 to R193.1 million in 2023/24.
In contrast, accruals and payables, where an invoice has not yet been received or paid,
increased sharply from R28.4 billion in 2022/23 to R37.1 billion in 2023/24. This increase
in unpaid obligations is particularly pronounced in the health and education sectors, driven
by rising service delivery demands due to population growth and the impact of higher
sectoral inflation. These pressures highlight the need for improved cash flow management
and prioritisation of spending.
Medico-legal claims
Medico-legal payments divert critical funds from healthcare services, exacerbating other
problems, such as outdated equipment, understaffing and medication shortages. Many
provinces either underestimate or fail to budget for these payments.
Contingent liabilities from medico-legal claims have decreased significantly, from
R111.2 billion in 2019/20 to R76 billion in 2023/24, while expenditure on these claims fell
from R1.7 billion to R1.5 billion over the same period. Although the liability remains
alarmingly high, reflecting ongoing court cases and continued financial strain on the health
sector, the improvement follows sustained efforts by provinces to address the root causes.
Provinces are enhancing internal controls, including improving patient record management,
enhancing patient safety, refining mediation processes and conducting forensic
investigations into medico-legal claims.
MUNICIPAL REVENUE AND SPENDING
Greater commitment is needed from municipalities to ensure residents and businesses
pay their bills, improve internal governance and ensure effective use of resources to meet
the needs of their communities.
As part of a five-year programme of action to improve local governance, the National
Treasury is leading a comprehensive review of the local government fiscal framework. This
review, which was endorsed by the Budget Forum in October 2024, aims to refine the
funding model to ensure it is equitable, efficient and responsive to the diverse needs of
municipalities. Key reforms include revising the local government equitable share formula
to better target poor households and account for cost differences across municipalities. In
addition, the National Treasury is consulting stakeholders as part of developing norms and
standards for municipal electricity surcharges to help reform municipal revenue collection.
The challenges facing local government go beyond funding. Weak political and
administrative management has resulted in persistent failures – including poor cash flow
management, irregular and wasteful expenditure and non-compliance with financial
management statutes – that highlight the need for stronger accountability. Vacancies in
CHAPTER 6

critical senior management positions, weak internal controls and poor implementation of
audit findings further undermine financial discipline and service delivery.
CHANGES TO PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL ALLOCATIONS
Adjustments to allocations since the 2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement address
critical infrastructure needs, improve service delivery and enhance revenue collection.
These adjustments include the first set of reforms flowing from the conditional grants
review.
Progress on the conditional grants review
Following a comprehensive review of the conditional grant system and extensive
stakeholder consultation, government has developed targeted reforms to be phased in over
the next three years. These reforms will enhance the effectiveness, equity and sustainability
of the system by streamlining the grant framework and integrating certain grants into the
provincial equitable share. Some reforms will be introduced during the 2025 MTEF period.
Further preparation, including consultations and impact assessments, will follow the tabling
of the 2025 Budget to ensure the successful rollout of longer-term reforms.
The reforms aim to better address the diverse needs of provinces and municipalities by:
• Refining allocation methodologies to balance equity and efficiency.
• Strengthening co-funding requirements to promote shared responsibility.
• Reducing restrictive earmarking to allow greater flexibility in fund use.
• Introducing performance-based incentives to improve accountability.
• Aligning related grants to reduce fragmentation and duplication.
Streamlining the grant system will reduce duplication and administrative burdens in
municipalities. Proposed measures include merging water reticulation grants into a unified
water infrastructure fund, consolidating energy grants, combining urban development
grants, and replacing grants for road maintenance, sports development and capacitybuilding initiatives with better-suited provincial programmes. Implementation will be closely
monitored to ensure the intended objectives are achieved while maintaining fiscal discipline.
A key development is the introduction of the urban development financing grant, which
merges the metro component of the neighbourhood development partnership grant and
a portion of the programme and project preparation support grant. The new grant is
intended to strengthen the management of and infrastructure investment in municipal
entities that supply water and sanitation, electricity, energy and solid waste management
services. Allocations will be transferred to metros based on the achievement of targets
related to management accountability, transparency and institutional capability; financial
performance, including better collections, cash flow, debtors management and capital
investment; and service delivery efficiency, such as reduced losses and better quality and
reliability. The grant will be augmented by results-based financing from international
development finance partners such as the World Bank. This merged grant will have
baselines of R518 million in 2025/26, R678 million in 2026/27 and R709 million in 2027/28.
Over the MTEF period, R8.5 billion is provisionally allocated pending the fulfilment of
agreed performance conditions and obligations by metropolitan municipalities. Additional
CHAPTER 6

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 69
results-based financing in 2025/26 is linked to the urban settlements development grant,
which supplements municipal capital budgets for bulk infrastructure.
In the provincial sphere, the expanded public works programme integrated grant will be
merged with the social sector expanded public works programme incentive grant from
2025/26, combining their allocations.
Furthermore, the municipal systems improvement grant will be discontinued, with funds
redirected to the Department of Cooperative Governance for municipal support. In
addition, R494 million in 2025/26 will be shifted from the direct to the indirect component
of the municipal infrastructure grant to address wastewater infrastructure issues in
21 municipalities. Allocations of R76 million in 2025/26, R83 million in 2026/27 and
R86 million in 2027/28 are shifted from the municipal infrastructure grant to the
integrated urban development grant as Alfred Duma Local Municipality has become
eligible to participate in the integrated urban development grant.

70 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The local government equitable share formula has been updated to include revised cost
factors for bulk services such as electricity and water. For the 2025 MTEF period, the
formula will continue to use the 2023/24 household estimates from the 2024 MTEF
formula. This approach provides stability in allocations until Statistics South Africa releases
a new data series based on the 2022 Census. Similarly, the proportion of households below
the affordability threshold in each municipality continues to be based on 2011 Census
data. This is because the 2022/23 Income and Expenditure Survey data was delayed and
has not been released at the municipal level to enable updates to the local government
equitable share formula for the 2025 Division of Revenue Bill.
Updating the formula with the latest official data is necessary to ensure that municipal
allocations reflect demographic changes. To this end, the National Treasury is engaging
with Statistics South Africa so that the necessary data is available for the 2026 Budget.
UPDATE ON THE MUNICIPAL DEBT-RELIEF PROGRAMME
Many of the 71 municipalities in the municipal debt-relief programme are failing to meet
the required conditions for national government to write off their arrears debt to Eskom
in equal tranches over three years. Key issues include persistent non-payment of monthly
electricity accounts and an inability to collect the mandated 85 per cent of revenue. Fortyseven municipalities have consistently defaulted and already accumulated substantial
arrears after receiving debt relief. Despite monthly support from provincial treasuries,
these municipalities continue to struggle with financial management, risking removal from
the programme.
The National Treasury has issued final warnings to several municipalities, including
Mangaung Metro, Richtersveld and Inxuba Yethemba. Termination from the programme
will require municipalities to repay their debt and accumulated arrears in full while facing
credit control measures from Eskom, such as legal proceedings and the introduction of
prepaid bulk electricity systems. The National Treasury and provincial treasuries will
continue to enforce programme conditions and support municipalities. Municipalities
need to improve efforts to meet their obligations by implementing cost-reflective tariffs,
sustainably managing free basic services, and exploring smart prepaid meters to improve
revenue collection and financial sustainability.
While challenges persist, there are success stories. Eleven municipalities have had onethird of their debt written off after meeting the programme conditions. These successes
highlight the programme’s potential to improve municipal financial stability.
STRENGTHENING DISASTER RISK FINANCING
The National Treasury is leading reforms to enhance the disaster risk financing framework
in the context of increasingly frequent and severe disasters. Reforms are aimed at ensuring
that disaster response is timely, efficient and equitable, while proactively reducing risks. A
CHAPTER 6
 DIVISION OF REVENUE AND SPENDING
 BY PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 71
multi-layered risk financing strategy has been developed that will address overreliance on
budget reallocations, which often delays disaster response and recovery.
Insights from high-risk municipalities
The National Treasury surveyed the 40 municipalities at highest risk of natural disasters. The
results highlighted significant delays in municipalities accessing disaster response funds and
recovery grants, averaging five months and 12.25 months respectively. These delays hinder
an effective response in resource-constrained municipalities. Complex application,
verification and reporting processes, combined with limited technical capacity, exacerbate
the delays, particularly in smaller municipalities. Challenges such as access to disaster sites,
reliance on consultants and unclear processes are contributing factors.
In coastal and rural municipalities, which are heavily reliant on disaster recovery grants,
reported expenditure often falls below allocations due to data discrepancies – such as issues
with data quality and reporting practices – and spending challenges. Disaster risk reduction
remains underfunded, with ageing infrastructure and poor maintenance increasing
vulnerability. Inefficiencies are worsened by fragmentation, delays in provincial collation for
disaster declarations and unclear roles across government.
CONCLUSION
The 2025 Budget Review emphasises the need for structural reforms to improve revenue
generation, efficiency and accountability in provinces and municipalities. Government is
implementing targeted reforms to address these challenges. Stronger intergovernmental
collaboration and improved governance at all levels of government are also required.

GOVERNMENT DEBT AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 73
OVERVIEW
The 2024/25 budget deficit was R31.8 billion higher than projected in the 2024 Budget
Review as revenue collection fell below expectations. However, debt redemptions were
R73.8 billion lower than estimated a year ago as the bond-switch programme continued
to exchange shorter-dated for longer-dated bonds. As a result, the gross borrowing
requirement, which consists of the budget deficit, maturing debt and the Eskom debtrelief arrangement, decreased from a projected R457.7 billion to R415.7 billion for
2024/25, or from 6.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent of GDP.
Over the past year, improved investor sentiment has contributed to a more benign
financing environment. The major factors contributing to this positive trend were the
formation of the government of national unity, the absence of load-shedding and interestrate reductions. These developments were also reflected in South Africa’s credit rating
outcomes, which either remained stable or were upgraded from stable to positive.
Gross debt stock is expected to increase from R5.69 trillion in 2024/25 to R6.81 trillion in
2027/28. Net loan debt – gross loan debt less cash balances – will increase from
R5.47 trillion to R6.7 trillion over the same period. Gross loan debt is now expected to
stabilise at 76.2 per cent of GDP in 2025/26.
The National Treasury has developed a debt sustainability forecasting model to enhance
its framework for analysing fiscal sustainability. The model incorporates findings from an
international benchmarking exercise to improve the framework’s usability and technical
capabilities.
The model will be used to forecast government debt and debt-service costs, create macrofiscal scenarios and assess the sustainability of public debt under different conditions. It
will do so by simulating the impact of changes in macroeconomic and fiscal variables,
including expenditure, debt, debt-service costs, the sovereign risk premium and the
exchange rate.
In brief
• The gross borrowing requirement has declined from R457.7 billion at the time of the
2024 Budget to R415.7 billion in 2024/25, largely due to lower debt redemptions as a
result of government’s bond-switch programme.
• In 2025/26, the gross borrowing requirement is expected to be R3 billion higher than
projected in the 2024 Budget Review due to a higher budget deficit, partially offset by a
reduction in Eskom debt relief.
• Gross loan debt is expected to stabilise at 76.2 per cent of GDP in 2025/26, slightly higher
than the level of 75.3 per cent projected in the 2024 Budget, and to decline thereafter.
• Debt-service costs stabilise at 21.7 per cent of revenue in 2024/25 and decline thereafter.
• Over the medium term, dedicated instruments will finance some infrastructure projects.
CHAPTER 7
GOVERNMENT DEBT AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
74 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
FINANCING STRATEGY
Government borrowing is guided by three primary considerations: liquidity management,
refinancing risk and managing the cost of borrowing. With these factors in mind, and
supported by a strategic risk framework (Table 7.1), government determines the best mix
of debt instruments and maturities to finance the gross borrowing requirement.
In 2025/26, the gross borrowing requirement will be financed through a combination of
domestic short- and long-term loans and foreign-currency loans. Cash balances will be
increased to finance a portion of the Eskom debt-relief arrangement in 2025/26. In
addition, government has introduced two shorter-dated (9-year and 15-year) bonds to
help minimise borrowing costs, and will continue to refinance high redemptions coming
due over the next three years through the bond-switch programme.
As indicated in the 2024 Budget Review, the financing strategy will support public
infrastructure financing, with a focus on attracting private-sector capital. Over the medium
term, some projects will be financed through dedicated, innovative infrastructure
instruments that will not increase the gross borrowing requirement.
Government is also preparing a credit guarantee vehicle to mobilise private capital by derisking critical projects in the energy, transport and water sectors. The arrangement is
projected to have initial capital of US$500 million.
As part of continuously developing South Africa’s capital market and ensuring a diversified
portfolio of instruments, government is developing a sustainable finance framework to
raise funding through the issuance of green or sustainability-linked bonds.
Risks to the financing strategy
The main risks to the financing strategy are as follows:
• Higher borrowing costs as a result of geopolitical risks and exchange rate volatility,
which could reduce South African bond holdings by non-resident investors.
• Weaker economic growth, which could reduce revenue performance and lower the

 GOVERNMENT DEBT AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 75
• Materialisation of contingent liabilities at state-owned companies.
Government monitors and manages these risks to the financing strategy. Most of South
Africa’s debt is issued in the domestic market, reducing the impact of global volatility.
BORROWING PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS
In 2025/26, the gross borrowing requirement will amount to R582 billion, including
payments to Eskom of R80.2 billion – R30 billion lower than the 2024 Budget estimate. The
requirement is also affected by the transfer to government of R100 billion in 2024/25 and
R25 billion in each of the two following years from the Gold and Foreign Exchange
Contingency Reserve Account, as discussed in the 2024 Budget Review.
The borrowing requirement is expected to decline to R441 billion in 2026/27, then
increase to R600 billion in 2027/28. Domestic and foreign redemptions increase from
R172.8 billion in 2025/26 to R303.7 billion in 2027/28. The bond-switch programme will
mitigate refinancing risks by spreading redemptions over time.
Update on Eskom debt-relief arrangement
The 2023 Budget Review announced government’s decision to provide Eskom with debt relief
amounting to R254 billion to strengthen its balance sheet, restructure the business and invest
in necessary maintenance.
By 31 March 2025, government will have advanced R140 billion in debt relief to Eskom. This is
a reduction of R4 billion from the original amount projected up to this point, owing to the
utility’s failure to meet the deadline for the disposal of the Eskom Finance Company. Under
the terms of the arrangement, the remaining elements are a R40 billion advance and a
R70 billion debt takeover scheduled for 2025/26.
As the agreement moves towards closure, government has decided, in consultation with
Eskom, to simplify the final phase of the debt relief – a change that also reflects some
improvement in the utility’s financial position flowing from the interventions to date. The final
R70 billion debt takeover will now be replaced with two advances amounting to R50 billion:
R40 billion in 2025/26 to redeem debt maturing in April 2026 and R10 billion in 2028/29 for
debt maturing in May 2028.
In summary, over the five-year period, government will have provided Eskom with loans to the
value of R230 billion to assist the utility in repaying its debt. This is about R24 billion less than
projected at the outset, reducing the gross borrowing requirement. In accordance with the
original agreement, the debt relief provided to Eskom will be converted into government
equity over time.

Domestic short-term borrowing
Government’s short-term borrowing consists of Treasury bills and borrowing from the
Corporation for Public Deposits. In 2024/25, net Treasury bill issuances grew by R5.9 billion
to R38.9 billion. Government also borrowed from the Corporation for Public Deposits to
manage liquidity levels.

 GOVERNMENT DEBT AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 77
Over the next three years, net Treasury bill issuances will average R40.7 billion, or about
10 per cent of total domestic borrowing. Government will continue to use the Corporation
for Public Deposits as a bridging finance facility.
Domestic long-term borrowing
Domestic long-term borrowing, which consists mainly of bonds, will amount to
R345 billion in 2024/25 and average R366.1 billion over the next three years. Between
April 2024 and February 2025, government raised R319.8 billion or 92.7 per cent of the
2024/25 amount. Fixed-rate bonds accounted for 65.6 per cent of the total, with floating
rate notes, inflation-linked bonds and retail bonds making up the remainder. RSA retail
savings bonds raised R7.5 billion in 2023/24 compared with R5.6 billion as at February
2025.
Figure 7.1 Interest rates on domestic government bonds
Source: National Treasury
The yield curve – the relationship between bonds of different maturities – has
strengthened by an average of 96 basis points since the 2024 Budget (Figure 7.1),
reflecting an improvement in investor sentiment.
Investor trends in the bond portfolio
Although foreign investors continue to hold the largest share of South Africa’s domestic
debt (24.6 per cent in December 2024), the percentage has declined somewhat in light of
higher risk aversion (Figure 7.2). Insurers and other financial institutions increased their
holdings over the past year, while pension funds decreased theirs over the same period.

International borrowing
Government borrows in foreign currency to meet its foreign-currency commitments. In
2024/25, government issued a dual-tranche bond, raising US$2 billion through 12-year
bonds and US$1.5 billion through 30-year bonds. Demand for these bonds significantly
exceeded supply, resulting in an increase in the issuance size from US$3 billion to
US$3.5 billion. In addition, a €400 million loan from the French Development Bank for the
implementation of the country’s Just Energy Transition Investment Plan was concluded,
with €200 million expected to flow in by the end of 2024/25 and the remainder in 2025/26.
Over the medium term, government will raise about US$14.6 billion to meet its foreign
exchange commitments. This funding will be sourced from multilateral development
banks, international financial institutions and international capital markets.

Cash balances
Government’s cash holdings consist of deposits held at commercial banks and the Reserve
Bank, which holds accumulated deposits from foreign-loan proceeds.
Government expects a closing cash balance of R230.7 billion at the end of 2024/25.
Domestic balances will amount to R140.4 billion, R90.4 billion higher than the 2024 Budget
estimate. The balances were increased to finance a portion of the borrowing requirement
in 2025/26. Over the medium term, foreign-currency balances will average US$3.4 billion.

GOVERNMENT DEBT AND DEBT-SERVICE COSTS
National government debt
National government debt is expected to stabilise at 76.2 per cent of GDP in 2025/26 –
marginally higher than the 75.3 per cent projected in the 2024 Budget – and to decline
thereafter. Foreign-currency debt will average R717 billion or 11.1 per cent of gross debt
over the medium term, well within the 15 per cent risk benchmark. This exposure is partly
offset by foreign-currency deposits, which amounted to US$4.6 billion in 2024/25.
In 2024/25, debt stock increased by R434.2 billion. The main budget deficit accounts for
81.2 per cent of this increase, while interest-, inflation- and exchange-rate changes
account for the remainder. The medium-term increase in gross loan debt will be driven by
the budget deficit and the financing of the Eskom debt-relief arrangement.
National government debt-service costs
Debt-service costs are determined by the debt stock, new borrowing and macroeconomic
variables such as interest, inflation and exchange rates. In 2024/25, debt-service costs are

 GOVERNMENT DEBT AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 81
revised upwards by R7.4 billion compared with the 2024 Budget estimate, mainly due to
the higher budget deficit. As a share of GDP, debt-service costs are projected to average
5.3 per cent over the medium term; as a share of revenue, they are expected to peak in
2024/25, declining thereafter.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities are state obligations that could result in expenditure if a specific
event occurs. Government closely monitors the status of these liabilities, which include
guarantees to state-owned companies, independent power producers and public-private
partnerships (PPPs), along with provisions for multilateral institutions and other fiscal
obligations.
Government’s guarantee exposure consists of the sum of the outstanding value of a loan,
accrued interest and adjustments to inflation-linked bonds. The guarantee amount,
however, reflects only the capital value of the loan. As a result, exposure may exceed the
approved guarantee amount.
The total guarantee amount is expected to decrease from R498.9 billion on 31 March 2024
to R491.9 billion on 31 March 2025, and the exposure amount will increase by R6.1 billion
to R439.2 billion over the same period. The reduction in the total guarantee amount is due
to the termination of the Land Bank’s R8 billion guarantee at the end of 2023/24.
The increase in exposure results from a R12.3 billion net drawdown on the Transnet
guarantee. This increase was offset by the net repayment of the South African National
Roads Agency Limited debt of R6.3 billion and repayments on the South African Reserve
Bank Loan Guarantee Scheme of R3.5 billion. Eskom, the Development Bank of Southern
Africa and the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority have made additional drawdowns,
resulting in an increase in their exposure amounts.
The implementation of Treasury Instruction No. 9 of 2020/21 has continued to reduce the
volume of guarantees issued, with some improvement in credit quality. Eskom remains
the largest guarantee exposure, constituting about 81 per cent of the portfolio. With the
implementation of the Eskom debt-relief arrangement, the volume of exposure to Eskom

has declined. However, given Eskom’s share of guarantee exposure, the risk from stateowned companies remains elevated.
Cabinet members who have requested guarantees for state-owned companies are
required to report those requests to Parliament once they have been considered by the
Minister of Finance.
Other guarantees and contingent liabilities
Contingent liability risks from independent power producers are low. As at 31 March 2025,
government’s commitment to the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer
Procurement Programme is expected to be R277.9 billion. The value of signed projects,
which represents government’s exposure, is expected to amount to R229.5 billion by
31 March 2025, declining to R166.4 billion by 2027/28. PPP exposure arises mainly from
early termination of contracts. In 2024/25, PPP contingent liabilities fell by about
R600 million to R6.2 billion as projects reached maturity. Total exposure is expected to
decline to R4.3 billion in 2025/26, R2.9 billion in 2026/27 and R2.4 billion in 2027/28.
Table 7.11 shows government’s exposure to multilateral institutions and other implicit
contingent liabilities. South Africa subscribes to shares in several multilaterals but does
not pay the full amount. These commitments represent the unpaid portion of the share
subscribed to in the unlikely event these institutions run into financial difficulty.

Net valuation profits and losses
Government’s largest contingent asset is the Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency
Reserve Account (GFECRA). It reflects profits and losses on gold and foreign exchange
reserves held by the Reserve Bank to meet foreign exchange obligations and to maintain
liquidity in the presence of external shocks. GFECRA is estimated to reach R343.7 billion
by 31 March 2025. In 2024, the National Treasury and the Reserve Bank signed a revised
GFECRA settlement agreement that allowed for the disbursement of R100 billion in
2024/25 and R25 billion in each of the following two years to government, reducing
government borrowing. It also provided for the disbursement of R100 billion to the
Reserve Bank’s contingency reserve. The GFECRA buffers will be reviewed and reported
on annually.
CONCLUSION
Government continues to manage its debt portfolio in a prudent and sustainable manner.
Gross debt is now expected to stabilise in 2025/26 at 76.2 per cent of GDP.

FINANCIAL POSITION OF PUBLIC-SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 85
In brief
• State‐owned companies remain distressed due to weak governance, financial pressures
and ongoing operational challenges.
• Eskom is making progress on its recovery plan, although its finances remain weak and
operational performance requires significant improvement.
• Transnet is hampered by high debt levels and needs to make faster progress on its
recovery plan to improve operations and finances.
• Development finance institutions continue to support economic growth. Social security
funds remain critical for social protection, with the Unemployment Insurance Fund and
Compensation Fund showing financial resilience.
OVERVIEW
This chapter reports on the financial position of major state‐owned companies,
development finance institutions and social security funds. Many state‐owned companies
continue to operate at a loss and have become dependent on substantial government
support.
STATE-OWNED COMPANIES
For over a decade, most state‐owned companies listed under schedule 2 of the Public
Finance Management Act (1999) have not met the legal requirements to maintain
sustainable profitability, manage risks effectively and generate returns while ensuring
prudent use of public resources. Various initiatives, including turnaround plans agreed
with government, are under way, but progress has been mixed. Notably, Eskom and
Transnet are implementing recovery plans agreed to during 2023/24.
Table 8.1 summarises the financial position of major state‐owned companies. Total assets
grew by 2.6 per cent to R1.35 trillion in 2023/24. Total liabilities, however, grew by
6.4 per cent, mainly due to R76 billion in debt relief – recognised as a liability – disbursed
to Eskom. This amount was converted to equity in 2024/25 after being assessed for
compliance with the debt‐relief arrangement.

FINANCIAL POSITION OF PUBLIC-SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
86 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
In 2023/24, state‐owned companies reported a negative return on equity of 15.6 per cent,
highlighting an ongoing inability to turn a profit. Sales were subdued owing to operational
constraints and inefficiency, while costs remained high. In the context of persistent
weakness, government has to make difficult choices on the future of these companies.
Options include closures, mergers and withdrawal of financial support. Poor quality
management and the adoption of mandates that are not financially feasible should also
be addressed. Failure to make proactive decisions will result in continued fiscal pressure
or financial collapse, leading to service disruptions and large job losses.
Meanwhile, state‐owned companies continue to use the majority of their cash to meet
debt obligations. Cash flows remain insufficient to cover operational costs, financial
obligations and capital requirements. Consequently, these companies are unable to
effectively fulfil their mandates. With government support, capital expenditure increased
by 28 per cent from 2022/23 to 2023/24. However, major backlogs persist.

DEBT OBLIGATIONS
Figure 8.2 shows state‐owned company debt maturing over the medium term. It excludes
Eskom, South African Airways, Transnet and Denel because their quarterly reports are
outstanding. Debt repayments of R37.4 billion are expected in 2024/25, of which
R2.6 billion is guaranteed by government. Over the medium term, aggregate debt
maturities are expected to amount to R62.9 billion, of which R11.5 billion (18 per cent) is
government guaranteed.
Restrictions on Eskom borrowing as part of the debt‐relief arrangement alongside weaker
balance sheets in other state‐owned companies have resulted in a large reduction in
borrowing (Table 8.2). Over the medium term, state‐owned companies expect to prioritise
domestic funding with long‐term maturities to address their financing needs.

Denel
Denel remains unable to meet its financial obligations. As outlined in the
2024 Budget Review, Denel was granted R3.4 billion in the Special Appropriation Act
(2022) to implement its turnaround plan. It was permitted to access a portion of the funds
after meeting certain milestones, although the completion of some targets – particularly
the sale of non‐core assets – remains outstanding. As Denel has implemented aspects of
the plan, government is granting access to the remaining ring‐fenced funds. After debt
repayments in the past year, these amount to R914 million. These funds will help Denel to
cover legacy obligations, invest in essential capital projects and optimise restructuring.
Eskom
Eskom continues to rely on government support through the debt‐relief arrangement in
order to operate. Revenue grew by 14 per cent to R295.8 billion in 2023/24 due to an
18.7 per cent tariff increase, while sales fell by 3 per cent. Losses doubled to R55 billion in
2023/24 due to tariffs that do not reflect costs, poor operational performance, non‐

payment by municipalities and high finance costs. Municipal debt to Eskom rose from
R74.4 billion at end‐March 2024 to R94.8 billion at end‐December 2024.
Progress on unbundling has been slow. After Eskom failed to dispose of the Eskom Finance
Company by the agreed deadline, government reduced the debt‐relief allocation by
R4 billion. Chapter 7 outlines the current status of the Eskom debt‐relief agreement.
The Department of Electricity and Energy is preparing to issue a request for proposals for
a pilot independent transmission project in November 2025. This will invite the private
sector to assist the National Transmission Company in expanding transmission lines.
South African Post Office
The South African Post Office (SAPO) was placed in business rescue on 10 July 2023. In
2023/24, SAPO reduced costs and met some operational targets, yet it remains financially
stressed due to high net losses and low revenue. SAPO used the R2.4 billion allocated in
2022/23 to implement a business rescue plan, including cutting costs and paying creditors.
As part of this plan, it closed 354 branches and retained 657 branches. The National
Treasury and the Department of Communications and Digital Technologies are working
with the business rescue practitioners to ensure the effective implementation of the plan.
Transnet
With the support of Operation Vulindlela, Transnet is addressing a years‐long financial and
operational decline. Rail volumes fell from 226.3 million tonnes in 2017/18 to 151.7 million
tonnes in 2023/24 due to derailments, inefficiency and infrastructure damage. Transnet
has made some progress in implementing its recovery plan, and estimates indicate that
rail volumes will reach 165.4 million tonnes by the end of 2024/25.
In 2023/24, Transnet reported a net loss of R7.3 billion, relative to R5.1 billion in 2022/23,
largely due to increased finance costs. Additional debt and higher interest rates pushed
finance costs to R14.3 billion in 2023/24, placing further strain on cash flows. Transnet’s
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation declined from R22.8 billion
in 2022/23 to R22 billion. Revenue gains were offset by rising net operating expenses.
Transnet needs to stabilise and reduce its debt. Since 2018, Transnet has shifted funds
from capital expenditure to debt servicing. While this prevented default, the shift has
come at the expense of maintaining and expanding critical infrastructure. Government
provided a R47 billion guarantee in December 2023, which Transnet used to refinance
maturing debt and take on new debt. Government is now providing direct support to
critical infrastructure projects, such as the expansion of the land‐side container terminal
in Cape Town, while avoiding debt relief or general balance sheet support. Total borrowing
increased by R7.6 billion to R137.7 billion between end‐March 2023 and end‐March 2024,
underscoring the need for better debt management.

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE INSTITUTIONS
Development finance institutions (DFIs) support government’s strategic objectives by
channelling investments into critical sectors and developing small‐ to medium‐sized
businesses. Table 8.3 summarises the financial position of selected DFIs.
As at 31 March 2024, the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) accounted for
65 per cent of the net asset base of national DFIs, followed by the Development Bank of
Southern Africa (DBSA) at 31 per cent.
Development finance institutions borrowed R21.4 billion in 2023/24, slightly below the
planned R24.5 billion. In 2024/25, the DBSA and IDC are projected to borrow R23.5 billion.
Domestic borrowing is expected to constitute 65.5 per cent (R15.4 billion) of total funding.

FINANCIAL POSITION OF PUBLIC-SECTOR INSTITUTIONS

Development Bank of Southern Africa
In 2023/24, the DBSA disbursed R16.9 billion, with 65 per cent allocated to projects in
South Africa and 35 per cent to projects in other parts of Africa. The bank supported
infrastructure projects valued at R2.5 billion against an annual target of R1.5 billion. The
DBSA reported a strong financial performance in 2023/24, with net interest income
increasing by 18 per cent to R7.7 billion, driven by higher interest rates and robust loan
disbursements. Net profit fell by 11 per cent from R5.2 billion to R4.6 billion between
2022/23 and 2023/24 due to higher impairments and lower foreign exchange gains, but
earnings grew to R4.5 billion (2022/23: R4.2 billion) due to resilience in core operations.
Industrial Development Corporation
Most of the IDC’s funding during 2023/24 supported capacity expansion, startups,
distressed businesses and working capital requirements. In 2023/24, the IDC approved
funding amounting to R17.3 billion, compared with R20.7 billion in 2022/23, while actual
disbursements decreased from R20.5 billion to R15.9 billion. Net profit declined to
R7.8 billion from R10.7 billion in 2022/23. Revenue increased by 8 per cent to R24.3 billion,
supported by favourable interest rates and a growing loan book. However, reduced
investment income and operational challenges in subsidiaries, along with a weaker mining
and metals portfolio as commodity prices fell, offset these gains.
The Land Bank
In September 2024, the Land Bank reached an agreement with its lenders to resolve the
default triggered in April 2020. This solution includes measures to stabilise operations,
strengthen finances and restructure debt. Between April 2020 and December 2024, debt
was reduced from R40.6 billion to R10.8 billion.
In 2023/24, net profit fell to R21 million from R515 million the previous year. Expected
credit losses in 2022/23 were based on an overestimate of loan defaults, but losses
increased in 2023/24, requiring higher provisions. The non‐performing loan ratio rose from
51.9 per cent to 53.1 per cent, largely because the total value of loans decreased, making
non‐performing loans a larger proportion of the loan book. The bank disbursed
R723 million in loans and grants, falling short of its R1.5 billion target.
The Land Bank has increased its development and transformation portfolio from
10 per cent of total loans in 2017/18 to 41 per cent in 2023/24. This growth is driven by
the blended finance scheme, launched in 2022, which combines grants from the
Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development with loans from the Land
Bank to support emerging farmers. In 2023/24, the bank disbursed all loans and grants –
totalling R723 million – through the blended finance scheme, compared to R6.9 million in
2022/23.

SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS
Social security funds provide income support and compensation to individuals facing
unemployment or those affected by road and workplace accidents. Over the medium
term, these funds are projected to generate total revenue of R289.4 billion, primarily from
contributions and earmarked allocations. Total expenditure is anticipated to amount to
R300.8 billion, mainly designated for benefit payments.
As of 2023/24, aggregate assets held by these funds stood at R287.3 billion, with the
Unemployment Insurance Fund comprising 52.7 per cent of this total. Total liabilities were
reported at R416.2 billion, of which the Road Accident Fund accounted for 84.9 per cent,
equivalent to R353.3 billion. Comprehensive financial data for these funds is available in
the Estimates of National Expenditure.
Unemployment Insurance Fund
The Unemployment Insurance Fund, established under the Unemployment Insurance Act
(2001), offers short‐term unemployment insurance to eligible workers. Over the medium
term, the fund aims to enhance its provision of social insurance benefits while extending
coverage to vulnerable groups and contributors. Technological advancements are central
to these plans, including improvements to mobile applications. Over the medium term,
R22.9 billion is allocated to implement labour activation programmes across the country,
with a target of creating 2 million short‐term jobs. Beneficiaries will be identified through
the Employment Services of South Africa system. The fund’s net asset value is forecast to
rise from R137.3 billion in 2024/25 to R145.5 billion in 2027/28 as surpluses accumulate.
Compensation Fund
The Compensation Fund, including the Mines and Works Compensation Fund, provides
compensation to employees for disablement or death caused by occupational injuries or
diseases. Over the medium term, the fund aims to improve the efficiency of claims
adjudication and processing. It has introduced an integrated employer portal, enabling
registered employers to submit earnings returns, make annual assessment payments and

obtain letters of good standing online. Benefit payments are projected to grow by
2.2 per cent annually, from R7.4 billion in 2024/25 to R7.9 billion in 2027/28. The
aggregate net asset value of the Compensation Fund and the Mines and Works
Compensation Fund is expected to improve from R81.7 billion in 2024/25 to R94.2 billion
in 2027/28, underpinned by the accumulation of surpluses.
Road Accident Fund
The Road Accident Fund (RAF) compensates road users for losses or damages resulting
from motor vehicle accidents, funded through the RAF levy. Long‐term provisions are
expected to rise from R355 billion in 2023/24 to R370.3 billion in 2024/25, and
R423.3 billion by 2027/28, accounting for a large share of total liabilities. The RAF’s
expenditure is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 19.1 per cent, from
R53.1 billion in 2024/25 to R89.7 billion in 2027/28.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES PENSION FUND
Membership in the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF), a defined benefit
pension fund for public‐sector employees, grew by 0.8 per cent in 2023/24. At end‐March
2024, the fund recorded its highest membership to date, with 1 777 902 active members
and 544 765 pensioners and beneficiaries. The GEPF is solvent, with statutory actuarial
valuations confirming that its assets exceed its best estimate of liabilities. Total benefits
paid for claims increased from R137.4 billion in 2022/23 to R142.5 billion in 2023/24,
primarily due to higher pensionable salaries in 2023/24. Contributions income rose from
R83.1 billion in 2022/23 to R92.2 billion in 2023/24, strengthening the fund’s financial
position. At end‐March 2024, the GEPF reported a net cash flow position of R59.7 billion.
CONCLUSION
The financial performance of public‐sector institutions remains mixed, with difficult
choices required over the medium term. Government continues to support struggling
state‐owned companies while implementing measures to improve their operational and
financial sustainability. Addressing the challenges faced by these institutions is crucial for
sustained economic growth and social development.

ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 93
INTRODUCTION
SecƟon 7(4) of the Money Bills and Related MaƩers Act (2009) requires that the Minister of Finance
submit a report to Parliament during the tabling of the budget explaining how the Division of
Revenue Bill and the naƟonal budget give effect to recommendaƟons made by Parliament or
providing reasons for deviaƟng from these recommendaƟons. The recommendaƟons to which this
annexure responds are contained in:
• Budgetary review and recommendaƟon reports (BRRRs) submiƩed by porƞolio commiƩees of
the NaƟonal Assembly in terms of secƟon 5 of the act.
• Reports submiƩed by the finance commiƩees in terms of secƟon 6 of the act on the fiscal
framework proposed in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS).
• Reports submiƩed by the appropriaƟons commiƩees in terms of secƟon 6 of the act on the
proposed division of revenue and the condiƟonal grant allocaƟons to provinces and local
governments set out in the MTBPS.
BUDGETARY REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION REPORTS
In terms of secƟon 5 of the act, the NaƟonal Assembly commiƩees must assess the performance of
each naƟonal department before the budget is introduced and prepare budgetary review and
recommendaƟon reports. These reports:
• Must provide an assessment of the department’s service delivery performance given available
resources.
• Must provide an assessment of the effecƟveness and efficiency of the department’s use and
forward allocaƟon of available resources.
• May include recommendaƟons on the future use of resources.
This annexure provides responses to the recommendaƟons of porƞolio commiƩees and those from
finance commiƩees, parƟcularly where they relate to the NaƟonal Treasury.
Several commiƩees recommended allocaƟng addiƟonal budget for certain programmes, subprogrammes or other budget items. Tax measures in the 2025 Budget will make it possible to
accommodate some criƟcal spending prioriƟes while maintaining the fiscal stance. Nonetheless,
there remains limited scope to fulfil mulƟple recommendaƟons for addiƟonal budget given the
constrained fiscal outlook. ReprioriƟsaƟon of exisƟng funds remains the primary tool for
departments, public enƟƟes and other insƟtuƟons to fund emerging prioriƟes. Furthermore, all
accounƟng officers must implement measures to minimise inefficiency and waste to improve value
for money.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR
The committee should be regularly updated on engagements between the department and the
National Treasury on preferential procurement status of the Supported Employment Enterprises
(SEE).
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
94 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Prior to the enactment of the Public Procurement Act (2024), the NaƟonal Treasury advised the
department to develop a policy on preferenƟal procurement within government. This policy would
require departments to procure goods and services from SEEs; however, development of this policy
has yet to commence. Notwithstanding, the NaƟonal Treasury is commiƩed to supporƟng the
department, as the custodian of the SEEs programme, to engage the Office of the Chief Procurement
Officer on this maƩer and provide a comprehensive report to the commiƩee.
Application should be made to the National Treasury (NT) for budget surpluses of other entities
within the Employment and Labour portfolio that are not going to be utilised by those entities to be
transferred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).
As noted in the 2024 Budget, public enƟƟes and consƟtuƟonal insƟtuƟons are required to annually
submit surplus retenƟon requests to the NaƟonal Treasury in terms of secƟon 53(3) of the Public
Finance Management Act (1999) and NaƟonal Treasury InstrucƟon 12 of 2020/21. Cash surpluses of
enƟƟes are evaluated as standalone applicaƟons and approval is granted based on the moƟvaƟon
provided, which details how the surplus arose and what it will be spent on, if approved. Should an
enƟty only be granted a parƟal surplus retenƟon or not be granted approval to retain the surplus,
those funds revert to the NaƟonal Revenue Fund. As such, surpluses of one enƟty cannot be
transferred to another enƟty. In addiƟon, some enƟƟes’ founding legislaƟons sƟpulate what any
surplus should be used for.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION
The department should provide additional funding to colleges to expand the offering of occupational
programmes. The department needs to assist Technical and Vocational Education and Training
colleges with additional funding to improve the uptake of occupational qualifications developed by
the Quality Council for Trades and Occupations, which are in demand in the industry.
In the 2024 Budget, R15 billion was made available in the post-school educaƟon and training system
to fund the occupaƟonal programmes at technical and vocaƟonal educaƟon and training colleges.
This included funding from the technical and vocaƟonal educaƟon and training subsidies, the
NaƟonal Student Financial Aid Scheme, the NaƟonal Skills Fund and sector educaƟon and training
authoriƟes through the skills development levy.
In light of the expanding mandate and scope of work of the Council on Higher Education, additional
funding should be considered for the entity to implement its new fit-for-purpose organisational
structure that matches the work that needs to be done; make progress in implementing its Digital
Transformation Strategy and carry out the increased scope of work.
As noted in the 2024 Budget, the Council on Higher EducaƟon’s baseline was increased by an
addiƟonal allocaƟon of R19 million in 2022/23 and R25 million in 2023/24 to address criƟcal capacity
needs and implement its mandate. In addiƟon, the council retained a cash surplus of R4.4 million in
2023/24 to enhance its informaƟon and communicaƟon technology infrastructure and resources as
part of the planned phased implementaƟon of the new Quality Assurance Framework.
Additional funding over the MTEF period (2025/26 – 2027/28) should be considered to: enable the
South African Qualifications Authority to fund automation and digitisation; verification of South
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 95
African qualifications and the National Qualifications Framework Chair (Research); and implement
the phased-in approach of the automation Project Phoenix.
The South African QualificaƟons Authority was authorised to retain a cash surplus of R108.4 million
in 2023/24 to address criƟcal capacity challenges and to implement its mandate. These surplus funds
are being used for rolling out the business process automaƟon project, operaƟonal commitments as
per the NaƟonal QualificaƟons Framework Act (2008), the purchase of a new office building,
conƟngent liabiliƟes arising from pending legal cases and various research projects. Furthermore,
the authority is receiving a transfer payment from the department totalling R292.3 million over the
medium term.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SPORT, ARTS AND CULTURE
The committee notes that the cost containment measures that are still in place for 2024/25,
specifically in relation to cost of employment, stifle the department’s efforts to reduce its vacancy
rate. The committee further notes that the department has made a request for an adjustment budget
for 2024/25 of R10 million, however, this is still not sufficient to address staffing deficiencies and will
have implications for service delivery. The Minister of Finance should work with the department to
implement the necessary budget adjustments to address staffing deficiencies.
The compensaƟon of employees ceiling requires departments to evaluate their personnel budgets
and only fill criƟcal posts. In undertaking that exercise, the impact of the carry-through costs must
also be taken into consideraƟon. The NaƟonal Treasury is willing to assist the department in
implemenƟng necessary budget adjustments to address staffing deficiencies. However, cauƟon
should be exercised to ensure that compensaƟon of employees does not crowd out other service
delivery prioriƟes.
The committee has heard the appeals of several entities that require additional funding to address
deficiencies in their operational budgets, including but not limited to the Mandela Bay Theatre
Complex, the Amazwi Museum, the South African Library for the Blind, and the South African
Heritage Resources Agency. The committee notes the Minister’s response to the 2023 BRRR which
indicates that additional funding to public entities will have to be done through reprioritising funds
within departmental allocations.
The White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage advocates for the amalgamaƟon of affected enƟƟes
to enable the sharing of resources and administraƟve funcƟons, saving costs and ensuring the
sustainability of these enƟƟes. However, in a leƩer to the Minister of Finance dated 2 September
2024, the Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture announced the cancellaƟon of the amalgamaƟon of
enƟƟes. Accordingly, the liquidity of some of the department’s enƟƟes remains a concern. The
department has been advised to work with all enƟƟes to eliminate the pracƟce of budgeƟng for cash
deficits in terms of secƟon 53(3) of the Public Finance Management Act. Given fiscal constraints
affecƟng all parts of the state, enƟƟes must remain within their allocated budgets.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
96 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
The committee raised a concern that budget cuts imposed by National Treasury affected service
delivery to the poor. There should be a mechanism where political representatives of the
departments can make representations to National Treasury on behalf of their departments.
The budget is adopted by Cabinet and endorsed for tabling in the NaƟonal Assembly every year.
Cabinet is chaired by the President and composed solely of all ministers of the state. The budget is
the decision of the poliƟcal representaƟves in the execuƟve and is passed into law by poliƟcal
representaƟves in the legislature. Furthermore, recommendaƟons from the Technical CommiƩee on
the Budget (composed of officials) are tabled at the Ministers’ CommiƩee on the Budget before they
are taken to Cabinet for approval, while intergovernmental allocaƟons are discussed at the Budget
Council and the Budget Forum, each of which is composed of poliƟcal leadership from the provincial
and local government spheres. Finally, the chairs of the Finance and AppropriaƟons commiƩees from
both houses of Parliament have standing invitaƟons to Budget Council and Budget Forum meeƟngs.
Overall, therefore, the annual budget process is highly consultaƟve, and departments are given the
opportunity to make representaƟons and submissions to inform the discussions in the Technical
CommiƩee on the Budget.
Against the above backdrop, the commiƩee is also advised that no new budget reducƟons are
effected in the baselines of insƟtuƟons in the 2025 Budget.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, YOUTH AND PERSONS WITH
DISABILITIES
The committee requests National Treasury to consider the requests for rollover of funds for the
department and the Commission for Gender Equality.
In the 2024 Adjustment Budget, the NaƟonal Treasury approved a rollover request of R13 million
from the Department of Women, Youth, and Persons with DisabiliƟes for the payment of contractual
obligaƟons and commitments. Of this amount, R5 million was allocated to the Commission for
Gender Equality as an increase to its transfer payment in 2024/25. Furthermore, the NaƟonal
Treasury approved the Commission for Gender Equality’s retenƟon of a cash surplus of R7.7 million
from the previous year for use in 2024/25.
The committee requests that National Treasury considers the continuation of the Presidential Youth
Employment Initiative in the 7th Administration.
In 2025/26, R549.8 million has been allocated to the NaƟonal Youth Development Agency under the
presidenƟal employment iniƟaƟve. Moreover, the 2024 Budget announced funding of R7.4 billion
for the presidenƟal employment iniƟaƟve.
The committee requests National Treasury to reassess the funding allocation to the department to
optimally implement its respective mandates.
The Department of Women, Youth and Persons with DisabiliƟes has been provided with addiƟonal
funding of R20 million in 2025/26, R20.9 million in 2026/27 and R21.8 million in 2027/28.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 97
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEES ON AGRICULTURE, LAND REFORM AND RURAL
DEVELOPMENT
The Minister of Finance must consider the impact of budget reductions for land reform
(redistribution, tenure reform and restitution) in view of the constitutional imperative and the
potential risks associated with slow pace of delivery of land, especially the settlement of all the pre1994 land claims as well as labour tenants’ applications:
• In addition, note that the recent Communal Property Associations Amendment Act (2018)
commits the State to setting up institutions and capacity to administer the Communal Property
Associations Act effectively.
• Internal reprioritisation of funds has reached a point where it could potentially have negative
effect on key programmes of the Department of Land Reform and Rural Development.
The NaƟonal Treasury acknowledges the commiƩee’s concerns about the slow progress in seƩling
land claims and processing labour tenants’ applicaƟons, largely aƩributable to court rulings that
caused unforeseen funding gaps. To address these issues, the department should expedite the
review of the rural development financing model, focusing solely on coordinaƟng rural infrastructure
development rather than duplicaƟng projects such as building roads and schools. This revision could
free up departmental resources that can be reallocated to accelerate land delivery without
negaƟvely impacƟng rural development programmes. AddiƟonally, the Agricultural Land Holding
Account should enhance its budget uƟlisaƟon processes to minimise unspent funds being returned
to the NaƟonal Revenue Fund or seek to retain any surpluses.
The Minister of Finance, in consultation with the Minister and the Department of Land Reform and
Rural Development, the Chief Land Claims Commissioner, and the Office of the Valuer-General,
consider reviewing the land reform and rural development financing model to increase the allocation
for restitution:
• To ensure that all the pre-1998 land claims lodged (old order land claims) in terms of the
Restitution of Land Rights Act (1994) are settled over the next five years.
• To support the implementation of Project Kuyasa, focusing on the autonomy of the Commission
on Restitution of Land Rights as recommended by the South African Human Rights Commission,
the Auditor-General of South Africa, the High-Level Panel on Assessment of Key Legislation and
Fundamental Change, and the Portfolio Committee.
The NaƟonal Treasury concurs with the commiƩee’s proposal and will work together with the
Department of Land Reform and Rural Development to find an appropriate financing model. Due to
the constrained fiscal environment, the NaƟonal Treasury welcomes the review of the current
financing model for land reform programmes, which is expected to free up resources that can be
reallocated to pressing resƟtuƟon programme prioriƟes such as seƩling old order land claims. The
Office of the Valuer-General should enhance its capacity by filling criƟcal frontline posiƟons, as the
current staff shortages lead to costly dependence on private land valuers. Furthermore, it should
work to minimise unspent funds being returned to the NaƟonal Revenue Fund.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
98 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Given the land claims court order in the Mwelase and Others matter, confirmed by the Constitutional
Court, compelling the State to settle all outstanding labour tenant applications lodged in terms of
the Labour Tenants (Land Reform) Act (1996) over the next five years, allocate a ring-fenced budget
for the department, under the supervision of the Special Master of Labour Tenants at the Land Claims
Court, to facilitate settlement to, and post settlement support for, all labour tenants’ applicants
whose claims are valid.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. Government finances are currently
operaƟng with an unsustainable deficit that will exceed R374 billion by the end of March 2025.
ReprioriƟsaƟon is advised to fund spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes.
In view of the Communal Property Associations Amendment Act No. 20 of 2018, assented to by the
President on October 8, 2024, particularly Section 2B and 2C which establishes the Communal
Property Associations Office and the appointment of a Registrar, and outside the usual internal
reprioritization of the budget, allocate additional funding for the support of Communal Property
Associations in line with the Act.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. Government finances are currently
operaƟng with an unsustainable deficit that will exceed R374 billion by the end of March 2025.
ReprioriƟsaƟon remains the primary mechanism to fund spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes.
Consider a budget allocation to the Onderstepoort Biological Products for the Good Manufacturing
Practice Facility:
• The Onderstepoort Biological Products is a National Key Point and the only manufacturer of
certain animal vaccines in the country and the continent, which is on the verge of collapse due to
aging infrastructure. The Onderstepoort Biological Products operates on very old infrastructure
and equipment that has been in use for more than 30 years and has surpassed its 15 to 20-year
lifespan.
• This has resulted in frequent equipment breakdowns, thus constraining the Onderstepoort
Biological Products’ ability to produce sufficient quantities of animal vaccines for diseases of
economic importance as and when required.
Onderstepoort Biological Products was allocated over R492 million in 2018/19 to upgrade
equipment and build the vaccine manufacturing facility; however, progress has been slow. According
to the report presented to the Onderstepoort Biological Products shareholders on 31 October 2024,
R153.4 million remained unspent for the Good Manufacturing PracƟce project. The NaƟonal
Treasury also noted that the enƟty’s sales revenue increased significantly from R170.1 million in
2021/22 to R232.3 million at the end of 2023/24, driven by the sale of vaccines in the export market.
Consider for approval the Agricultural Research Council’s funding application from the Budget
Facility for Infrastructure that was submitted in May 2024:
• The required funding is for the construction of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccine Facility,
whose delay has a negative impact on the local availability of the vaccine and the health of the
national herd.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 99
• The vaccine is currently sourced from Botswana, which is not only costly but poses a serious
biosecurity risk to the country, compounded by concerns about the Botswana vaccine’s longevity
of immunity as it has not been tested under local conditions.
• Currently, the country is struggling with outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease, with serious
implications for livelihoods and the economy as some export markets have placed bans on South
African livestock products.
The NaƟonal Treasury is collaboraƟng with the council and the department to enhance compliance
and explore funding opƟons, including reprioriƟsing funds towards infrastructure projects. Despite
an iniƟal R500 million allocaƟon over a decade ago, construcƟon has progressed slowly. Recently,
the council secured approval to retain an accumulated surplus of R13.6 million, raising the total
allocaƟon for the facility to R885.1 million. Efforts are ongoing to expedite the project’s compleƟon.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TOURISM
The National Treasury should increase the ring-fenced budget to capitalise the Tourism
Transformation Fund and Tourism Equity Fund.
ImplementaƟon of the revised R1.2 billion Tourism Equity Fund has faced delays, reflecƟng broader
challenges in fully using allocated budgets. Both funds underscore the need for conƟnued efforts to
streamline processes and enhance their impact on economic transformaƟon.
National Treasury should appropriate a ring-fenced budget to facilitate tourism development and
growth in villages, townships and small towns.
The Department of Tourism is already implemenƟng mulƟ-year spaƟal planning and infrastructure
projects that support rural and township economies, with an allocaƟon of R924 million over the
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) period. The spaƟal planning and infrastructure
projects provide support for community-based tourism projects and community museums. They will
conƟnue to contribute to tourism development and ensure that tourism benefits accrue to
communiƟes, especially those around key aƩracƟons and sites in rural areas.
National Treasury should approve the filling of vacancies in the department to enable the tourism
sector to create more jobs and continue to contribute immensely to the GDP of the country.
Authority to fill vacant posts vests with the Department of Public Service and AdministraƟon. The
NaƟonal Treasury provides input on the availability of funds to fill vacancies. The Department of
Tourism is aligning its process to fill vacant posts with the requirements of the direcƟve by the
Minister of Public Service and AdministraƟon dated 2 April 2024 (ImplementaƟon of control
measures aimed at assisƟng ExecuƟve AuthoriƟes in managing fiscal sustainability during the
process of creaƟng and filling vacant posts in departments).
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
The committee recommends that the National Treasury allocates the additional R2.4 billion needed
to offset the existing shortfalls in bursary and grant support.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
100 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. Given the current constrained fiscal
environment, there is limited scope for addiƟonal funding to departments and enƟƟes.
ReprioriƟsaƟon remains the primary mechanism to fund spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes.
The committee recommends that the National Treasury allocate R570 million that South African
National Space Agency needs for its satellite build and launch capability. This includes R350 million
for Earth Observation Satellite 1, R120 million for launch capability and R100 million for the
development of Synthetic Aperture Radar technology.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. ReprioriƟsaƟon remains the primary
mechanism to fund spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes. Nevertheless, the South African
NaƟonal Space Agency is advised to consider private-sector partnerships or blended finance
approaches for this project. The enƟty can obtain further advice from the Development Bank of
Southern Africa or the Government Technical Advisory Centre.
The committee recommends that the National Treasury allocate the needed R35 million for the
Innovation Fund and the R100 million for the Pre-seed Fund to the Technology Innovation Agency.
The NaƟonal Treasury has conducted a spending review exploring the agency’s role and efficiency in
the commercialisaƟon and development of intellectual property from publicly funded insƟtuƟons.
The review is under consideraƟon by the Department of Science, Technology and InnovaƟon.
Concurrently, the agency is conducƟng its own internal insƟtuƟonal review, which will also be
submiƩed to the department for consideraƟon. Both processes must be concluded before addiƟonal
funding requests for the agency can be considered.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND MILITARY VETERANS
As in previous years, it remains evident that there is limited progress in addressing the compensation
of employees over-expenditure in the Department of Defence. The committee therefore reiterates
the recommendation by the Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans of the 6th
Parliament that a long-term, permanent solution is based on the development of a new Human
Resources management strategy or adjustment of the current strategy to ensure long-term stability
in the South African National Defence Force’s personnel contingent by focusing specifically on force
rejuvenation. It is recommended that this plan be developed in consultation with the National
Treasury and that the plan be fully funded to achieve the desired outcomes. Of specific importance
to this recommendation is that the strategy should create a permanent exit mechanism for older
soldiers who will not advance in their military careers and that such an exit mechanism ensures a
smooth transition to civilian life through, for example, vocational training, job placement, and/or
monetary assistance. The strategy should be adapted for the unique socio-economic conditions in
South Africa on the one hand and be fully aimed at creating long-term force rejuvenation and
compensation of employees stability in the Department of Defence. The committee noted previous
indications that the National Treasury is open to engaging with the Department of Defence on the
matter and therefore requests feedback from National Treasury once engagements on the plan start.
The NaƟonal Treasury has made similar recommendaƟons to the department in the past without
any tangible progress on the maƩer. The NaƟonal Treasury is open to engaging with the Department
of Defence on the maƩer and will parƟcipate accordingly should the department require the
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 101
NaƟonal Treasury’s involvement in draŌing the human resources management strategy. The
NaƟonal Treasury will brief the commiƩee accordingly once invited to do so.
Dependent on the development of an agreement on a long-term stabilisation and rejuvenation plan
as noted above, the committee recommends that National Treasury considers the allocation of
additional funds to the Department of Defence to fund the compensation of employees’ shortfall
while the rejuvenation plan is implemented.
Over the next two years, the Department of Defence will parƟcipate in the government-wide early
reƟrement programme without penalisaƟon of pension benefits. This is intended to achieve two key
objecƟves. First, it aims to rejuvenate the force by creaƟng opportuniƟes for the recruitment and
advancement of younger personnel, ensuring a more agile and capable defence force. Second, it
seeks to generate savings within the compensaƟon of employees’ budget, which can be redirected
to alleviate ongoing financial pressures in this area. Government finances are currently operaƟng
with an unsustainable deficit that will exceed R374 billion at the end of March 2025. Moreover, the
NaƟonal Treasury will conƟnue advising departments and Cabinet to consider difficult trade-offs to
fund criƟcal prioriƟes.
Adverse findings by the Auditor-General of South Africa related to the Department of Defence’s
procurement systems and its logistics management systems are often related to outdated
Information and Communication Technology systems and infrastructure in the Department of
Defence. Previously, Parliament recommended that the National Treasury provide the Department
of Defence with an additional ring-fenced allocation for the upgrading of Information and
Communication Technology systems in the procurement and logistics management environments.
During the 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework budget process, the National Treasury
advised departments and entities to reprioritize funds towards emerging priorities. The committee
recommends that a ring-fenced allocation in 2025/26 be reconsidered to boost the Information and
Communication Technology systems and infrastructure in the Department of Defence with the aim
to limit irregular expenditure.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. Government finances are currently
operaƟng with an unsustainable deficit that will exceed R374 billion by the end of March 2025.
ReprioriƟsaƟon remains the primary mechanism to fund spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes.
The National Treasury should indicate to the committee its view on whether the utilisation of the
South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to guard selected Critical Infrastructure can serve as
a cost-saving measure and the scope for implementation thereof.
The cost-effecƟveness of deploying the SANDF to safeguard criƟcal infrastructure should be
evaluated based on empirical evidence, as insourcing has, in some cases, proven to be expensive.
For example, past internal deployments of the SANDF have incurred high costs due to the
comprehensive mobilisaƟon of all capabiliƟes, highlighƟng the need for a more targeted and
efficient approach. A previous spending review by the Government Technical Advisory Centre
revealed that insourcing security services is generally more expensive due to higher public-sector
salary structures relaƟve to private-sector alternaƟves.

PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Additional funding should be allocated to Legal Aid South Africa to address the carry through costs
of the 2023/24 wage agreement, lack of relief capacity, and to increase court coverage. Legal Aid
South Africa must also be allocated an amount of R73.3 million to fund additional capacity required
flowing from the promulgation of the Land Court Act, and the shortfall in respect of fees due to legal
practitioners in land matters for pending instructions held on 1 January 2022 must be addressed.
The 2024 Budget shiŌed R156 million from the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural
Development to Legal Aid South Africa to seƩle fees owed to legal pracƟƟoners handling land-related
maƩers. At the same Ɵme, government finances are currently operaƟng with a deficit that will
exceed R374 billion at the end of March 2025. ReprioriƟsaƟon remains the primary mechanism to
fund spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes.
The Information Regulator must be allocated funds to meet the compliance and capacitation costs
of its listing as a Schedule 3A National Public Entity in terms of the Public Finance Management Act
(1999); for the continued capacitation of its structure; and to expand its footprint.
The cosƟng and idenƟficaƟon of funds should take place before an enƟty is established, rather than
aŌerwards. Against this backdrop, the NaƟonal Treasury reiterates that government finances are
currently operaƟng with a deficit that will exceed R374 billion by the end of March 2025.
ReprioriƟsaƟon remains the primary mechanism to fund spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes.
Concerning the South African Human Rights Commission and Public Protector South Africa, the
committee does not support any budget cuts to their allocations. The committee also supports the
Public Protector South Africa’s funding proposals, especially for security and additional capacity.
The 2025 Budget includes addiƟonal allocaƟons totalling R23 million and R73 million over the
medium term for the South African Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector South Africa
respecƟvely to address capacity constraints. No budget reducƟons are effected in the baselines of
insƟtuƟons in the 2025 Budget.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEES ON MINERAL AND PETROLEUM RESOURCES,

Assist the Council for Geoscience to secure more funding from the National Treasury as well as from
collaborative activities and partnerships so that the entity can contribute to South Africa’s Economic
Reconstruction and Recovery Plan by securing a minimum of 5 per cent of the global exploration
expenditure through the application of geoscience information and knowledge.
An addiƟonal R80 million in 2024/25 and R120 million in 2025/26 was allocated in the 2024 Budget
to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy for the establishment of an ExploraƟon Fund to
benefit junior miners. The Council for Geoscience, in collaboraƟon with the department and the
Industrial Development CorporaƟon, is managing this fund. Beyond this, it should be noted that
government finances are currently operaƟng with an unsustainable deficit that will exceed
R374 billion by the end of March 2025. ReprioriƟsaƟon remains the primary mechanism to fund
spending pressures and emerging prioriƟes.

Ensure that, together with the Minister of Finance, the funding models of the department’s entities
are addressed to ensure that they can fulfil their mandates.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. The NaƟonal Treasury is available to
engage with the department and affected enƟƟes on exploring possible funding models.
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT
The Minister of Finance through the National Treasury should assist the Department of Transport
and its entities, along with the Auditor General South Africa, to obtain a definitive interpretation or
definition of supply chain management (SCM) terminology and issues raised with Broad-Based Black
Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) compliance requirements to prevent future disputes during the
audit process linked to these terms.
AccounƟng officers and execuƟve authoriƟes are responsible for managing supply chain processes
in line with applicable legal prescripts and policies. As noted in the 2024 Budget, the NaƟonal
Treasury will conƟnue to liaise with the Department of Transport to provide guidance on interpreƟng
and applying specific SCM terminology. B-BBEE legislaƟon falls within the purview of the Department
of Trade, Industry and CompeƟƟon. The Department of Transport is thus advised to refer all queries
relaƟng to B-BBEE compliance to the Department of Trade, Industry and CompeƟƟon for guidance.
The Minister of Finance through the National Treasury should assist the Department of Transport
and its entities to receive final decisions on all alternative revenue source proposals submitted to
National Treasury from the transport portfolio and submit a progress report to the committee by the
end of January 2024.
As noted in the 2024 Budget, the NaƟonal Treasury has not received any alternaƟve revenue source
proposals from the Department of Transport and its enƟƟes for consideraƟon since 2023/24. The
NaƟonal Treasury considers proposals by departments and enƟƟes on a case-by-case basis for
acƟviƟes that are consistent with their mandates and where approval from the Minister of Finance
is required.
The Minister of Finance through the National Treasury should submit a progress report to the
committee by the end of January 2024 on the progress made with the Gauteng government, South
African National Roads Agency Limited and National Treasury to finalise the funding issues linked to
the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project e-tolling matter.
A memorandum of agreement has been signed between the naƟonal government and the Gauteng
provincial government detailing contribuƟons to be made towards the Gauteng Freeway
Improvement Project debt and maintenance backlog. This has made it possible for requisite
allocaƟons to be tabled in Parliament. This commiƩee’s recommendaƟon aligns with that of the
Standing CommiƩee on AppropriaƟons, which also requested a briefing from the NaƟonal Treasury
and the Department of Transport. In light of these recommendaƟons, the NaƟonal Treasury
proposes a joint briefing for both commiƩees and will await the official invitaƟon.

104 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON WATER AND SANITATION
The committee recommends that the Minister of Finance should not reduce the budget for the
Department of Water and Sanitation over the medium term considering the state of water in the
country and its importance in relation to other sectors such as health, energy, human settlements,
agriculture, among others – these sectors rely on water to function optimally.
No budget reducƟons are effected in the baselines of insƟtuƟons in the 2025 Budget.
The committee recommends that the Department of Water and Sanitation, National Treasury, South
African Local Government Association and the Department of Cooperative Government and
Traditional Affairs should develop a water debt management plan that should consider top slicing of
equitable share, Municipal Infrastructure Grant, among other sources to address municipal water
debt.
The NaƟonal Treasury is collaboraƟng with the Department of Water and SanitaƟon and the
Department of CooperaƟve Governance and TradiƟonal Affairs to idenƟfy pragmaƟc and legislaƟvely
feasible soluƟons to get municipaliƟes to prioriƟse debt repayments to water boards. The NaƟonal
Treasury plans to invoke secƟon 216 of the ConsƟtuƟon for five defaulƟng municipaliƟes. This entails
withholding the transfer of funds in the upcoming local government equitable share while
negoƟaƟng a feasible repayment agreement with the affected water boards.
The committee recommended that the department, together with the National Treasury should
develop a debt write off plan for municipalities that owe water boards in line with the debt
eradication framework currently used for municipal electricity debts to ESKOM.
The NaƟonal Treasury and the Department of Water and SanitaƟon are engaging on a mechanism
to facilitate debt recovery, which will allow water boards and debtor municipaliƟes to renegoƟate
repayment agreements. This mechanism involves wriƟng off a porƟon of the municipal debt
following the payment of the current account to water boards, and in turn water board arrears to
the Department of Water and SanitaƟon will also be wriƩen off. However, the mechanism does not
include the transfer of fiscal funding to water boards, as was the case in the Eskom arrangement.
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
The commiƩee recommends that NaƟonal Treasury increase South African Revenue Service’s (SARS)
baseline funding by R17–R20 billion over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. This
adjustment is essenƟal to address the operaƟonal gaps created by years of limited growth in grant
allocaƟons, ensuring South African Revenue Service can adequately meet its expanded mandate
under current inflaƟonary pressures. To support short-term revenue recovery iniƟaƟves, the
commiƩee recommends an annual allocaƟon of approximately R1 billion. This targeted funding
would improve South African Revenue Service’s capacity to enhance compliance measures and
achieve sustainable revenue growth, contribuƟng to naƟonal fiscal stability.
The NaƟonal Treasury recognises the importance of the work SARS does in collecƟng taxes and
duƟes, as well as its posiƟve impact on the fiscal framework. SARS has received addiƟonal allocaƟons
in previous budgets mainly for capital projects, capacity-building iniƟaƟves, skills requirements and
revenue-raising capabiliƟes such as data analyƟcs. During the 2023 Adjustment Budget, SARS
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 105
received an in-year addiƟonal allocaƟon of R1 billion to enhance its capacity and capability in tax
compliance and revenue collecƟon. In the 2024 Budget, an addiƟonal R1 billion was allocated each
year for 2024/25 and 2025/26 for this purpose. Furthermore, the 2024 MTBPS allocated addiƟonal
funding of R500 million in 2025/26, R1.5 billion in 2026/27 and R1.5 billion in 2027/28 to support
capital projects and strengthen the revenue-raising capabiliƟes of SARS. The NaƟonal Treasury will
conƟnue to engage SARS on its budget requirements for its priority projects and make the necessary
adjustments based on affordability and the capacity of SARS to fully roll out the implementaƟon of
projects.
For modernisaƟon, the commiƩee supports the allocaƟon of an addiƟonal R3 billion over the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. This investment should facilitate digital upgrades,
automaƟon, and improvements in taxpayer services and compliance efforts. The commiƩee further
recommends that a porƟon of this funding be used to extend SARS’ presence in rural areas through
mobile offices or other accessible plaƞorms, ensuring individuals in underserved communiƟes have
equitable access to tax services, enhancing broader tax compliance and inclusivity.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. The 2024 MTBPS allocated
addiƟonal funding of R500 million in 2025/26, R1.5 billion in 2026/27 and R1.5 billion in 2027/28 to
support capital projects and strengthen the revenue-raising capabiliƟes of SARS. The NaƟonal
Treasury will conƟnue to engage SARS on its budget requirements for its priority projects and make
the necessary adjustments based on affordability and the capacity of SARS to fully roll out the
implementaƟon of projects.
The commiƩee recommends an allocaƟon of R1.5 billion to support the hiring of 2 338 addiƟonal
resources. Strengthening SARS’ human resources is vital for improving service delivery, enforcing
compliance, and effecƟvely uƟlising data analyƟcs in tax administraƟon.
In the 2023 Adjustment Budget, SARS received an in-year addiƟonal allocaƟon of R1 billion to
enhance its capacity and capability in tax compliance and revenue collecƟon. In the 2024 Budget, an
addiƟonal R1 billion was allocated each year for 2024/25 and 2025/26 for this purpose.
Furthermore, the 2024 MTBPS allocated addiƟonal funding of R500 million in 2025/26, R1.5 billion
in 2026/27 and R1.5 billion in 2027/28 to support capital projects and strengthen the revenue-raising
capabiliƟes of SARS.
Given the dynamic nature of the tax and customs environment, the commiƩee recommends periodic
reviews of South African Revenue Service’s funding requirements. This approach will allow South
African Revenue Service’s budget to adapt responsively to technological advancements and evolving
priorities, helping maintain the organisation’s global competitiveness.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon. The annual budget process, through
baseline analyses, considers compeƟng prioriƟes before allocaƟon decisions are made. Nonetheless,
the constrained fiscal environment in recent years has limited the scope for addiƟonal funding.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STANDING AND SELECT COMMITTEES ON
FINANCE ON THE 2024 REVISED AND PROPOSED FISCAL FRAMEWORK
The Committee urges National Treasury and relevant departments to investigate and address the
root causes of underspending, including potential administrative bottlenecks, capacity gaps, and
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
106 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
procedural inefficiencies. Strengthening these areas would improve budget execution, enhance
service delivery, and ensure that government resources are utilized efficiently to meet the needs of
the public.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. The NaƟonal Treasury has well-established inyear expenditure monitoring through monthly and quarterly reports as part of the early warning
system to detect root causes of underspending and overspending, among other things. Once
deviaƟons are noted, these are communicated with relevant departments and enƟƟes. These
reports also inform in-year budget adjustment proposals.
The Committee emphasises the importance of balancing fiscal adjustments to ensure that essential
services are not compromised. While the R10.4 billion net increase reflects a responsive approach to
budget management, the reliance on contingency funds and projected underspending indicates
underlying challenges in budget predictability and control. The Committee encourages NT to further
streamline expenditure allocations and strengthen contingency planning, especially considering
South Africa’s pressing socio-economic needs and fiscal limitations.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon.
Revenue for 2024/25 is revised at R2.021 trillion, or 26.9% of GDP, with modest growth expected
over the medium term, reaching R2.471 trillion by 2027/28 and stabilizing around 27% of GDP. The
Committee notes the challenges in expanding the tax base and enhancing revenue due to the current
economic environment. To support fiscal sustainability, the Committee urges NT to continue to
explore avenues for improving tax compliance and stimulating economic growth.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. The addiƟonal allocaƟons proposed for SARS are
intended to improve tax compliance. At the same Ɵme, government is running a broad economic
growth agenda, including through OperaƟon Vulindlela.
The Committee acknowledges the projected narrowing of the budget deficit from -5.0% of GDP in
2024/25 to -3.2% by 2027/28, indicating a commitment to fiscal consolidation. However, the
persistent structural deficit raises concerns about vulnerability to revenue shortfalls and economic
downturns, especially given the optimistic economic outlook embedded in the projections. The
Committee recommends NT adopt contingency measures to safeguard deficit targets, ensuring fiscal
stability even if revenue shortfalls or unforeseen expenditures arise.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon.
Gross loan debt is expected at R5.623 trillion for 2024/25, reaching R6.818 trillion by 2027/28, with
the debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizing around 75%. The Committee remains concerned about high debt
levels and debt-service costs, which limit funds for essential services. Strengthening debt
management and exploring ways to reduce borrowing costs are recommended to mitigate fiscal
risks. In particular, the Committee stresses the need for NT to diversify funding sources and enhance
fiscal discipline to ensure long-term debt sustainability.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. CommiƩees of Parliament are urged to peruse
the debt management reports publicly released by the NaƟonal Treasury, as well as the debt
management updates in Chapter 7 of the annual Budget Review. These publicaƟons outline how
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 107
government has diversified funding sources and the policy benchmarks used to ensure that risks are
kept to a manageable level.
The tax gap remains a challenge, with an estimated gross gap of R1.061 trillion, 42% of total tax
liability, and a net gap of R800 billion. To bridge this gap, the Committee recommends further
resource allocation to SARS, including enhancing digital capacity and retaining critical skills.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. As noted earlier, SARS has received addiƟonal
allocaƟons in recent budgets. The 2024 MTBPS allocated addiƟonal funding of R500 million in
2025/26, R1.5 billion in 2026/27 and R1.5 billion in 2027/28 to support capital projects and
strengthen the revenue-raising capabiliƟes of SARS.
Budget constraints have led to reductions in SARS staffing, particularly affecting customs and excise.
Given the rising demands of cross-border trade and non-compliance challenges, the Committee
stresses the need for increased SARS funding to support modernisation and bolster tax compliance.
As noted earlier, SARS has received addiƟonal allocaƟons in recent budgets. The 2024 MTBPS
allocated addiƟonal funding of R500 million in 2025/26, R1.5 billion in 2026/27 and R1.5 billion in
2027/28 to support capital projects and strengthen the revenue-raising capabiliƟes of SARS.
To address revenue shortfalls projected at R22.3 billion for 2024/25, the Committee recommends
exploring progressive tax options, including taxes on luxury items and wealth taxes. Stakeholders
suggest this approach could reduce fiscal strain without overburdening low-income households.
SARS is collecƟng and analysing wealth-related data through its High Net Worth Individuals Unit;
however, no final decision has yet been made on the proposal.
The Committee recognises that high tax rates can impede economic growth and job creation. In light
of this, it recommends that the government, as part of its commitment to a pro-growth agenda, also
explores options to reduce certain taxes strategically. Lowering tax rates in key areas could stimulate
savings, attract investment, enhance international competitiveness, and support broader economic
growth and employment creation. Such an approach should be balanced to ensure that fiscal
sustainability remains intact while fostering an environment conducive to economic expansion.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon.
Fiscal consolidation has constrained aggregate demand. The Committee suggests that targeted
expenditure adjustments in high-impact sectors could support recovery, balancing austerity with
economic stimulus.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon.
The Committee notes the progress of OV reforms, particularly in the energy and logistics sectors.
While recognizing the potential of these reforms to drive economic growth, the Committee advises
that greater innovation and clearer timelines are essential to ensure tangible improvements in
critical services, such as water, sanitation, and infrastructure. Structural reforms in these sectors are
vital for fostering a growth-friendly environment, enhancing job creation, and boosting revenue
generation, thereby strengthening the fiscal framework. However, the Committee also
acknowledges concerns raised by stakeholders regarding OV’s inclination to shift resources from the
state to the private sector. This approach, while aimed at efficiency, may face opposition due to its
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
108 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
impact on public service delivery and the state’s role in essential services. The Committee
recommends that these concerns be carefully weighed to strike a balance that ensures effective
reforms while maintaining the state’s accountability to citizens.
The NaƟonal Treasury agrees that a balance needs to be struck between private-sector efficiency
and state accountability, and that it is important to find strategies to address challenges in water and
sanitaƟon, and implement infrastructure prioriƟes.
The Committee acknowledges the planned infrastructure spending growth of 10.6% annually,
reaching R160.6 billion by 2027/28, which aligns with goals under Operation Vulindlela. This
investment is critical for economic growth and service delivery. PPPs mobilize private resources for
infrastructure but carry risks of long-term costs and governance challenges. Stakeholders caution
against over-reliance on PPPs, as they can prioritize profits over public welfare. The Committee
recommends a balanced approach that incorporates government-led projects alongside PPPs.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon.
To enhance PPP outcomes, the Committee recommends standardized oversight, periodic reviews,
and transparent governance to ensure efficiency and minimize financial strain on the state.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon.
Prioritizing government-led projects in health, education, law enforcement and social welfare will
help maximize public benefits. Clear timelines, budgeted milestones, and performance targets are
recommended for infrastructure projects to ensure socio-economic benefits.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon.
Contingent liabilities from IPP guarantees pose fiscal risks. The Committee notes that long-term
contracts with IPPs represent potential liabilities that could impact fiscal stability. It recommends NT
provide a comprehensive report on these liabilities and adopt monitoring frameworks to manage
fiscal risks effectively.
The structure of the programme and its contracts significantly reduces the fiscal risk by miƟgaƟng
the likelihood of conƟngent liabiliƟes materialising. However, the extent to which these liabiliƟes
impact the fiscus remains conƟngent on government decisions. The monitoring process involves
acƟve engagement during the opening of bid windows to assess potenƟal risks and incorporate
appropriate miƟgaƟon measures. The Independent Power Producer (IPP) Office submits quarterly
reports on the programme to the NaƟonal Treasury. These reports undergo thorough review and are
subsequently presented to the Financial and LegislaƟve CommiƩee and the Minister of Finance, and
are incorporated into a comprehensive quarterly report submiƩed to Parliament. This regular
reporƟng to the NaƟonal Treasury and Parliament strengthens accountability and transparency,
safeguarding economic stability while advancing the energy transiƟon.
The Committee notes reports indicating that some public servants may be compensated above
market levels, while others may be under remunerated. To address these discrepancies, the
Committee recommends that public sector remuneration levels be systematically benchmarked
against market standards to ensure government pay scales align with market rates, thereby
promoting equitable, competitive, and sustainable remuneration practices across the public sector.

The NaƟonal Treasury acknowledges this recommendaƟon and will forward it to the Department of
Public Service and AdministraƟon.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS
ON THE 2024 MTBPS
The National Treasury should ensure that the proposed additional funding allocations made in the
2024 MTBPS are utilised in a manner that is cost effective, efficient, attaining value for money while
respecting the Laws and Regulations governing South Africa’s public finances. The full application of
the PFMA and Treasury regulations by all Accounting Officers and Accounting Authorities when
utilising public funds is mandatory and the Minister of Finance must ensure that there are
consequences for the violations of the PFMA, Treasury Regulations and all Treasury issued Practice
Notes governing the utilisation of public funds.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. The roles and responsibiliƟes of accounƟng
officers in budgetary control and consequence management are clearly defined in secƟon 39 and
secƟon 81 of the Public Finance Management Act. However, the NaƟonal Treasury will conƟnue to
monitor expenditure and report quarterly to Parliament.
National Treasury should provide a comprehensive report on overall government plans to improve
spending efficiencies, reduce fruitless and wasteful expenditures and irregular expenditure as
reflected in the reports of the Auditor General of South Africa. This should also be understood within
the context of the consistent failure of government institutions to pay invoices with the PFMA 30
days requirements and its impact on the overall financial viability of business, small, medium and
macro enterprises.
The NaƟonal Treasury is commiƩed to improving spending efficiencies and addressing fruitless,
wasteful and irregular expenditures highlighted in the Auditor-General’s reports. The NaƟonal
Treasury conƟnues to strengthen expenditure monitoring, enforce compliance with the Public
Finance Management Act and provide targeted support to departments and enƟƟes to enhance
financial management. Furthermore, the NaƟonal Treasury is intensifying efforts to ensure
adherence to the 30-day payment requirement, recognising its criƟcal impact on the financial
viability of businesses, parƟcularly small, medium and micro enterprises.
The National Treasury should ensure that government procurement structural reforms are centred
around Operation Vulindlela and briefs the Committee on Operation Vulindlela and all the
government proposed structural reforms.
OperaƟon Vulindlela, a joint iniƟaƟve of the Presidency and the NaƟonal Treasury, aims to accelerate
structural reforms in key network industries such as electricity, water, transport and digital
communicaƟons. Although procurement modernisaƟon supports these reforms, it falls outside the
iniƟaƟve’s scope. Key procurement reforms include the recent Public Procurement Act (2024), for
which regulaƟons are being developed. Other iniƟaƟves include improving informaƟon and
communicaƟon technology data transparency and digitalisaƟon.
Since the budgeted bandwidth within the MTBPS for wage increases for public sector employees was
at 4.7 per cent, the Minister of Finance should ensure that proposed wage increases as indicated in
the MTBPS should therefore be more realistic going forward.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
110 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The NaƟonal Treasury acknowledges this recommendaƟon. The final wage agreement is for a wage
increase of 5.5 per cent in 2025/26 and consumer price index-related increases over the subsequent
two years. This agreement will support greater certainty in budget planning. Nevertheless, the wage
adjustments sƟll allow government to meet its overall fiscal targets.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS
ON THE DIVISION OF REVENUE AMENDMENT BILL
That the Minister of Finance ensures that National Treasury provide a comprehensive report on the
review/assessment of all the conditional grants allocation that necessitated the merger,
discontinuation and even changes of conditional grants from direct to indirect and vice-versa. The
Committee want to understand the rationales of these decisions and its implications on service
delivery.
The NaƟonal Treasury will provide the requested informaƟon.
That the Minister of Finance ensures that National Treasury provide a comprehensive report on
terms of reference and progress made in reviewing the local government fiscal framework and due
to the urgency of this matter, provide quarterly progress reports to Parliament until this process is
finalised.
Terms of reference and governance documents have been finalised for the local government fiscal
framework review. Updates to the terms of reference, discussed on 14 October 2024, include a new
sub-theme on the verƟcal division of revenue and performance evaluaƟon measures for noncompliance. The NaƟonal Treasury remains commiƩed to commencing the review in the first quarter
of 2025/26.
The Minister of Finance should ensure that National Treasury brief Parliament on the Eskom
Municipal Debt Relief Programme. Parliament wants to satisfy itself on the practicality of these
conditions and thereby ensures that municipal balance sheets are not negatively impacted by
conditions that are impossible to implement. The Committee’s interest is on the provision of service
delivery to South Africans whilst acknowledging the debt obligations of municipalities to Eskom and
the Eskom debt relief programme that Parliament has approved.
The Eskom Municipal Debt Relief Programme addresses unsustainable municipal debt while
promoƟng sound financial management. Key condiƟons include meeƟng a revenue collecƟon rate
of at least 85 per cent, implemenƟng cost-reflecƟve tariffs and restricƟng free basic services to
indigent households. Non-compliance may result in programme terminaƟon, repayment of relief
debt and arrears and exclusion from medium-term revenue and expenditure framework grants. The
NaƟonal Treasury provides monthly support, monitors compliance, encourages smart prepaid meter
adopƟon and considers mandatory intervenƟons where needed. The NaƟonal Treasury remains
commiƩed to balancing debt obligaƟons with service delivery and will update Parliament
accordingly.
That both the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Basic Education ensure that National Treasury
provide, and the Department of Basic Education provide a comprehensive report to Parliament on
both the financial implications and the overall government strategy in funding and fully
implementing the BELA Act.

naƟonal and provincial level.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS
ON THE ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL
The National Treasury should provide a comprehensive report to the Committee and Parliament on
the reasons to allocate R30.847 million to the Department of Higher Education and R30.762 million
to the Department of Mineral Resources as unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure for the
funding of the new ministry as part of the national macro-organisation of government, within a
context of well-known general elections’ calendar. The Committee is of the view that the proposed
expenditure allocations related to compensation of employees, goods and services, and capital
assets in Higher Education, Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, and Mineral Resources and
Energy; and the Minister of Electricity and Energy are inconsistent with the provisions of unforeseen
and unavoidable expenditures as classified in section 30 of the PFMA. This report must further clarify
all the consideration and alternative budgeting processes that were considered to conclude on all
the unforeseen and unavoidable expenditures as proposed in the Bill.
The allocaƟons of R30.9 million to the Department of Higher EducaƟon and R30.8 million to the
Department of Mineral Resources as well as allocaƟons to other departments outlined above were
necessitated by the naƟonal macro-organisaƟon of government following the President’s
announcement of addiƟonal deputy ministers and new ministries. While the general elecƟons
calendar was known, the specific structural changes and the Ɵming of their implementaƟon were
not foreseeable during the preparaƟon of the budget. As such, these allocaƟons meet the criteria
for unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure under secƟon 30 of the Public Finance Management
Act, as they address the urgent operaƟonal requirements of the newly established ministries and
addiƟonal deputy ministers to ensure their effecƟve funcƟonality. AlternaƟve budgeƟng processes
were considered; however, reallocaƟon within the 2024 MTEF budget framework was insufficient to
meet the immediate needs that arose from the organisaƟonal change. A detailed report providing
further clarity and consideraƟons will be submiƩed to the CommiƩee and Parliament as requested.
The National Treasury should provide the Committee and Parliament with a comprehensive report
on the utilisation of R2.1 billion for the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) through section
16 of the PFMA. Given that the announcement of this deployment was made in December 2023, this
report must further clarify as to why this proposed allocation of R2.1 billion was appropriated under
Section 16 of the PFMA, rather than being included in the 2024 Budget Review. The Committee is of
the view that the utilisation of section 16 of the PFMA was not warranted in this instance.
The NaƟonal Treasury can provide a report in this regard. Funding for the Southern African
Development Community Mission in the DemocraƟc Republic of the Congo (DRC) could not be
accommodated in the 2024 Budget, as the SANDF deployment occurred in late December 2023, aŌer

the 2024 MTEF budget process had been finalised. In compliance with secƟon 16(4)(a) of the act,
the Minister of Finance submiƩed a report to Parliament and the Auditor-General within 14 days of
authorising the R2.1 billion expenditure under secƟon 16 of the act in July 2024. This report,
addressed to the Speaker of the NaƟonal Assembly and the Chairperson of the NaƟonal Council of
Provinces, outlined the jusƟficaƟon for the expenditure, including the escalaƟon of conflict in
Eastern DRC and the associated loss of life and injuries to SANDF personnel.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS
ON THE SPECIAL APPROPRIATION BILL
The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transport should ensure that National Treasury and the
Department of Transport brief the Committee and report to Parliament on the Memorandum of
Agreement entered by the National Treasury, the Department of Transport and the Gauteng
provincial government on the decisions and conditions of government taking over the GFIP debt
portfolio. This MOA has given rise to this Special Appropriation Bill that must be processed by
Parliament in line with the Money Bills Act. Parliament appreciates the sensitivity of some of these
agreements. However, Parliament still has a constitutional responsibility to hold the executive
accountable on any decisions taken regarding the utilisation of public funds. Furthermore,
Parliament, through both houses, has an accounting responsibility to the citizens in any decisions
taken by Parliament through the recommendations of its committees regarding the passage of
Money Bills. Parliament must be briefed on the MOA on its entirety, to exercise its oversight role over
the implementation of this Bill while scrutinising the rationality of the decision taken by government.
This commiƩee’s recommendaƟon aligns with that of the Porƞolio CommiƩee on Transport, which
also requested a detailed report from the NaƟonal Treasury. In light of these recommendaƟons, the
NaƟonal Treasury proposes a joint briefing for both commiƩees and will await the official invitaƟon.
The Minister of Finance ensures that National Treasury briefs the Committee on all the avenues
explored by government in engaging with international partners to mobilise the resources needed
to fund international court cases. This should be understood and reported within the overall context
of government’s fiscal consolidation policy and all the other myriads of issues affecting ordinary and
poor South Africans, the high levels of poverty, high levels of unemployment and high levels of
inequality.
The in-year allocaƟons to the Presidency, the Department of InternaƟonal RelaƟons and
CooperaƟon, and the Department of JusƟce and ConsƟtuƟonal Development through the Special
AppropriaƟon Act (2024) were made to ensure that South Africa adequately fulfils its diplomaƟc
obligaƟons in pursuing its case at the InternaƟonal Court of JusƟce. The NaƟonal Treasury will brief
the commiƩee on efforts to engage internaƟonal partners and explore co-funding mechanisms to
minimise the fiscal impact of internaƟonal legal proceedings.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON
THE ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL
The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance should develop clear and
proper financial management systems and the necessary support to ensure that additional
ANNEXURE A

allocations earmarked for rebuilding and rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by floods across
multiple provinces and municipalities are spent according to approved plans and for the intended
purpose before the end of the current financial year without incurring wasteful and fruitless
expenditure.
The NaƟonal Treasury has a well-established in-year expenditure monitoring system to ensure that
funds allocated for rebuilding and rehabilitaƟng infrastructure damaged by floods are spent
effecƟvely and in line with approved plans. In collaboraƟon with the Department of CooperaƟve
Governance, the NaƟonal Treasury will conƟnue to enhance financial management systems and
provide targeted support to provinces and municipaliƟes. The NaƟonal Treasury remains commiƩed
to ensuring that the addiƟonal allocaƟons are used efficiently and achieve their intended purpose.
The National Treasury and the departments of Transport and Human Settlements should develop
clear plans to ensure that the adjusted allocations for the Emergency Housing Grant and the
Provincial Roads Maintenance Grant are effectively and efficiently utilised in compliance with the
conditional grant framework to achieve value for money and the necessary impact on the ground.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. The development of the plans is the primary
responsibility of the line funcƟon departments. Nonetheless, the NaƟonal Treasury, in collaboraƟon
with the departments of Transport and Human SeƩlements, is commiƩed to ensuring that the
adjusted allocaƟons for the emergency housing grant and the provincial roads maintenance grant
are used effecƟvely and efficiently. Furthermore, the NaƟonal Treasury has a well-established in-year
expenditure monitoring system to ensure compliance with the approved plans, value for money and
measurable impact on the ground. The NaƟonal Treasury, together with the relevant departments,
will conƟnue to support provinces and municipaliƟes to address implementaƟon challenges.
The National Treasury should ensure that government departments implement clear measures to
improve self-financing mechanisms as part of addressing the continuous revenue shortfall in the
budget, and these funds should be used responsibly and effectively to address the impact on service
delivery programmes of the rising debt service cost and other spending pressures.
The NaƟonal Treasury has an established framework on self-financing to support departments in
enhancing their generaƟon of own revenue. Departments are encouraged to implement clear and
effecƟve measures to maximise self-financing opportuniƟes while ensuring that these funds are
responsibly used to reduce the impact of other spending pressures on service delivery programmes.
The NaƟonal Treasury will conƟnue to provide guidance and oversight to ensure that revenuegeneraƟng iniƟaƟves align with fiscal sustainability and service delivery objecƟves.
The Committee is of the view that, while the National Treasury together with the Department of
Social Development are still investigating the most responsible and sustainable methods of financing
the mooted universal Basic Income Grant, the current Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant should be
extended beyond March 2025 as a temporary measure to cushion grant beneficiaries in the absence
of jobs.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. Funding for the COVID-19 social relief of distress
grant will be extended for another year in 2025/26 while government conƟnues to explore
sustainable intervenƟons to address poverty and unemployment. It should be noted that the grant

REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT

is part of the social wage, which accounts for 61 per cent of consolidated non-interest spending over
the medium term.
During the 2025 Budget, the Minister of Finance should outline clear measures and efforts which will
be considered to ensure that the necessary consequence management is implemented against the
departments which have continuously declared under-expenditure without meeting service delivery
targets. The Committee is of the view that if not addressed, this has the potential to undermine
government targets set out in the National Development Plan (NDP): Vision 2030.
The NaƟonal Treasury acknowledges the commiƩee’s concerns. The NaƟonal Treasury, through the
annual budget process and in-year expenditure monitoring, makes allocaƟon recommendaƟons to
Cabinet aŌer considering the spending trends of departments. The roles and responsibiliƟes of
accounƟng officers in budgetary control and consequence management are clearly defined in
secƟon 39 and secƟon 81 of the Public Finance Management Act.
The National Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance should ensure that specific
consequence management measures are developed and put in place to address the impact of local
government under-expenditure, with R2 billion being surrendered to the National Revenue Fund
(NRF) this year. The Committee is of the view that such under-expenditure has the potential to
undermine much-needed basic service delivery and impact negatively on communities and therefore
clear and stricter measures should be taken to prevent this for the 2025/26 financial year.
The NaƟonal Treasury shares the commiƩee’s concerns. The observed underspending partly stems
from the recovery of grant funds misused by municipaliƟes for non-compliant purposes, such as
using infrastructure grants for operaƟonal expenses like salaries. These funds are clawed back
through the equitable share mechanism, appearing as underspending in financial reports. While this
recovery ensures compliance and proper use of public funds, it highlights the need for stronger
preventaƟve measures.
The Minister of Finance should ensure that all budget adjustments made due to unforeseen and
unavoidable circumstances adequately comply with the relevant provisions of the Public Finance
Management Act (PFMA), Treasury Regulations and other regulatory frameworks. The Minister
should further ensure the approval of the requested rollovers in compliance with section 6.4 of the
Treasury Regulations, together with section 30(2) of the PFMA.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. Budget adjustments due to unforeseeable and
unavoidable circumstances and rollover of funds are always carried out in line with the relevant
legislaƟons and regulaƟons, including those cited by the commiƩee.
All virements should be approved in terms of section 43 of the Public Finance Management Act
(PFMA), together with section 6.3 of the Treasury Regulations, particularly those that are beyond
8 percent of the amount appropriated under the main division. However, the Committee does not
support any movement of funds above 8 percent, which is because of poor planning and project
management and unsatisfactory performance by some government departments, and the executive
will have to apply the necessary remedial actions at their disposal to address such, if any.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. Virements and the shiŌing of funds are carried
out in line with the relevant legislaƟons and regulaƟons, including those cited by the commiƩee.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 115
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON
THE DIVISION OF REVENUE AMENDMENT BILL
The Minister of Finance should gazette the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill [B13 – 2024] once it
is signed into law and ensure that the National Treasury continues to assist all provinces and
municipalities where additional resources have been allocated to build proper financial management
capacity and internal control measures to safeguard these allocations from corrupt elements and
ensure that value for money is always achieved; failing which the necessary consequence
management must be implemented.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. All bills enacted by Parliament are gazeƩed.
The National Treasury, together with provincial treasuries, should continue to strengthen and
improve their early warning monitoring and oversight measures for conditional grant spending
through monthly expenditure reports. The National Treasury should further strengthen its regular
and quarterly expenditure reports, which are presented to the Standing and Select Committees on
Appropriations in Parliament. The Committee believes that these reports are critical in enabling these
two Committees to conduct in-year monitoring over the executive.
The NaƟonal Treasury agrees with the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon and will work to improve the
quality and scope of expenditure reports. In cases of condiƟonal grant misuse, the NaƟonal Treasury,
in collaboraƟon with relevant departments, will enforce the Division of Revenue Act by withholding
or stopping transfers to non-compliant municipaliƟes or provinces. These acƟons are essenƟal to
protect the integrity of the grant system and ensure funds are used as intended.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON
THE PROPOSED DIVISION OF REVENUE AND CONDITIONAL GRANT
ALLOCATIONS TO PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES AS CONTAINED IN THE
2024 MTBPS
During the 2025 Budget announcement, the Minister of Finance should outline clear medium term
spending plans for government that will ensure a stable economic recovery trajectory to address
government debt, major spending pressures which are mostly funded through reprioritisation or
even shifting of funds over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Moreover, the
National Treasury together with provincial treasuries should put proper financial management
systems in place to ensure that the proposed medium term allocations are spent according to
approved plans and are closely monitored to realise much-needed inclusive economic growth to
reduce unemployment, poverty and inequality.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. However, it should be noted that the tabling of
the annual budget and money bills is accompanied by explanatory publicaƟons such as the Budget
Review and the EsƟmates of NaƟonal Expenditure. These documents outline the various aspects of
the budget, including those cited by the commiƩee.
Whilst the Committee acknowledges the impact of financial bailouts to state-owned entities (SOEs)
and inadequate economic growth; the Minister of Finance should, in the next Budget, outline clear
measures to address the fast-growing debt service cost, which is crowding out much-needed
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
116 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
spending on service delivery programmes aimed at addressing poverty, unemployment and
inequality over the MTEF.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. Chapter 3 of the Budget Review provides an
outline of government’s strategy for fiscal sustainability. The 2025 Budget projects government debt
will stabilise in 2025/26 and debt-service costs will peak as a percentage of revenue in 2024/25 and
decline thereaŌer.
The National Treasury together with the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, should
expedite the finalisation of the Medium-Term Development Framework (MTDF) process, which
underpins both budget formulation and sector strategic imperatives, and further ensure that the
perpetual misalignment between the State of the Nation Address and the Budget is addressed.
Parliament should monitor the progress in this regard.
The Department of Planning, Monitoring and EvaluaƟon, as the department mandated for planning,
has engaged extensively with stakeholders, including the NaƟonal Treasury, in the development of
the MTDF. The NaƟonal Treasury has provided inputs into process and looks forward to collaboraƟng
with departments to align prioriƟes in the budget process.
The National Treasury, together with the Department of Basic Education (DBE), should ensure that
the proposed allocations for Basic Education are prioritised to address the challenges of
infrastructure backlogs and overcrowding over the MTEF, especially given that there is a need to
ensure that vacant teaching posts are filled and protected. Furthermore, the DBE should ensure that
adequate libraries and other facilities needed for schooling are built, especially in rural schools.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes the recommendaƟon. Provincial educaƟon departments (along with
provincial treasuries) are tasked with reviewing the budgets of provincial educaƟon departments to
ensure that priority areas are funded. The Department of Basic EducaƟon will provide the
infrastructure plans of the sector, which will indicate how they intend to resolve overcrowding.
Given the lack of inclusive economic activities, poverty levels, unemployment and inequality in the
country, the duration of the Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant should be extended beyond 31 March
2025 as a temporary intervention while the National Treasury and the Department of Social
Development continue to investigate the most sustainable and responsible revenue mechanism to
fund the mooted permanent universal Basic Income Grant.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. Funding for the SRD grant will be extended for
another year in 2025/26 while government conƟnues to explore sustainable intervenƟons to deal
with poverty and other intervenƟons. It should be noted that the grant is part of the social wage,
which accounts for 61 per cent of consolidated non-interest spending over the medium term.
The National Treasury should expedite the finalisation of reforming the Metro Trading Services Grant
to incentivise reforms to trading services and unlock additional infrastructure financing.
Reforming the metro trading services is a key priority for the NaƟonal Treasury to enhance the
financial sustainability, efficiency and capacity of trading services such as water, electricity and
sanitaƟon. The proposed reforms aim to incenƟvise structural and insƟtuƟonal improvements,
including governance, stronger financial management, improved revenue collecƟon and reduced
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 117
inefficiencies. These changes are essenƟal to ensuring that metros can sustainably manage trading
services and deliver high-quality services to their communiƟes.
The National Treasury and the Department of Small Business Development should ensure that,
within 90 days after the adoption of this Report by the House, a clear plan to support small businesses
is developed and implemented to stimulate economic growth and address rising youth
unemployment.
The responsibility to develop the plan to support small businesses rests with the Department of
Small Business Development. An addiƟonal allocaƟon of R313.7 million has been provided to the
department over the 2025 MTEF period to provide support to small businesses.
The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation that the National Treasury, together with
the Department of Cooperative Governance and the South African Local Government Association
(SALGA), should expedite the review of both the provincial and local government equitable share
formulas to address the 17 percent funding gap in local government. Moreover, the Committee
believes that a proper review of local government transfers is necessary, especially of the vertical
division of revenue; considering the increasing number of dysfunctional and financially distressed
municipalities, the factors of geography and rurality and the nature of localities; to ensure proper
equitable sharing of nationally raised revenue across all spheres of government.
A comprehensive review of the local government fiscal framework is under way to address
challenges such as the growing number of dysfuncƟonal and financially distressed municipaliƟes.
This review considers factors like geography, rurality and local characterisƟcs to ensure equitable
revenue sharing across government spheres. Regarding SALGA’s idenƟfied 17 per cent funding gap,
the NaƟonal Treasury has flagged data and methodological concerns, which are being addressed as
part of the review to ensure reliable calculaƟons. For provinces, reforms to the provincial equitable
share formula for the educaƟon component have been finalised but await Income and Expenditure
Survey data from StaƟsƟcs South Africa, with implementaƟon planned for the 2026 Budget.
While welcoming the finalisation of the review of the conditional grant system and the resulting
reforms, aiming to rationalise conditional grants and incorporate some into the provincial equitable
share over the MTEF period, the Committee recommends that such reforms should bring about the
much-needed balance between funding for new and existing projects, by making provision both for
constructing new projects and maintaining or refurbishing existing ones.
The NaƟonal Treasury welcomes the commiƩee’s recommendaƟon and supports the use of grants
for the development and refurbishment of new infrastructure, which are essenƟal for sustainable
growth and effecƟve service delivery. However, grants should not be used to fund maintenance, as
this responsibility should be addressed through cost-reflecƟve tariffs, parƟcularly at the local
government level. This approach will promote sustainable cost recovery and help prevent further
deterioraƟon of infrastructure.
Whilst the Committee welcomes the amendment of the Municipal Structures Act, both the National
Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Governance (DCoG) should, over the Medium-term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), develop clear measures to ensure that the implementation of the
District Development Model (DDM) is properly funded and ensure that all concerns related to the
DDM regulations are addressed with all the relevant role players in local government.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
118 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. Funding prioriƟes of the DDM remain part of the
annual budget process. However, it should be noted that the fiscus remains constrained, so there is
limited space for addiƟonal funding.
Regarding gender-responsive budgeting, the Committee reiterates its previous recommendation
that budget is a critical instrument for government to achieve both transformation and inclusive
economic growth, and therefore, the Minister of Finance, together with the Minister in the
Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, should ensure that adequate resources
are allocated for women, youth and people with disabilities. Furthermore, they should ensure that
enough resources are earmarked and transferred to provinces for the implementation of the
National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide; to help address the scourge of
gender-based violence and to ensure proper mainstreaming of gender issues including those of the
LGBTQIA+ community.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. The Department of Women, Youth and Persons
with DisabiliƟes is provided with an addiƟonal allocaƟon of R20 million in 2025/26, R20.9 million in
2026/27 and R21.8 million in 2027/28.
The National Treasury, together with provincial treasuries should, within 90 days of the adoption of
this Report by the House, ensure that provinces develop clear plans and specific measures to find a
way to enhance revenue generation mechanisms to augment their equitable share allocations to
address the funding challenges in the education and health sectors. Further, the Committee believes
that the quality of financial decisions made by provinces also impact on other provinces.
The NaƟonal Treasury will share this recommendaƟon with provincial treasuries through the
appropriate plaƞorms. For example, the NaƟonal Treasury is commiƩed to supporƟng provinces
through the Provincial Revenue Workgroup, which facilitates benchmarking and sharing best
pracƟces. AddiƟonally, the NaƟonal Treasury will conƟnue monitoring revenue collecƟon and
engaging with provinces on miƟgaƟon measures to improve revenue outcomes.
REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON THE SPECIAL
APPROPRIATION BILL
The Minister of Finance should approve and gazette the Special Appropriation Bill [B19 – 2024] and
the National Treasury, together with the Department of Transport, should ensure that the allocation
earmarked for the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP) debt redemption is used effectively
and efficiently for the intended purpose, and if there are any conditions for the allocation as
suggested by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), the National Treasury should follow the
due and proper process to publish those conditions to promote budget transparency as enshrined in
the Constitution.
The NaƟonal Treasury notes this recommendaƟon. These funds are earmarked to ensure that they
are used for the intended purpose in line with the Special AppropriaƟon Act (2024).
The National Treasury should ensure that any future infrastructure projects implemented by
government departments are properly planned, with a proper evaluation exercise, and undergo
rigorous public participation, social and economic feasibility studies and the necessary due diligence
and scrutiny to avoid similar challenges.
ANNEXURE A
REPORT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TO PARLIAMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 119
The NaƟonal Treasury remains commiƩed to assisƟng departments in improving infrastructure
project planning and delivery through exisƟng frameworks, guidance and evaluaƟon mechanisms,
ensuring alignment with sound financial and economic principles while respecƟng the
responsibiliƟes of the implemenƟng departments. AddiƟonally, in response to the challenges
menƟoned, the NaƟonal Treasury, in collaboraƟon with key government stakeholders, created the
Budget Facility for Infrastructure in 2016 as part of broader reforms to improve infrastructure
investment planning and execuƟon. However, its role is to provide support and oversight, rather than
taking full control of infrastructure planning and execuƟon, which remains the responsibility of
individual government departments.
The Committee reiterates its previous recommendation made during the 6th Parliament that it does
not encourage the introduction of special appropriation bills unless absolutely necessary and there
are exceptional circumstances that dictate this, as this may signal budgeting challenges. When such
bills are introduced, it needs to be done timeously, so that Parliament has sufficient time to satisfy
itself, engage with the public meaningfully, and process them accordingly to ensure full compliance.
The introducƟon of a special appropriaƟon bill is undertaken only in excepƟonal circumstances to
address urgent and unforeseen prioriƟes. The NaƟonal Treasury acknowledges the commiƩee’s
concerns and remains commiƩed to ensuring that such bills are introduced in a Ɵmely manner to
allow Parliament adequate Ɵme for meaningful deliberaƟon, public engagement and proper
processing. Special appropriaƟon bills are not indicaƟve of systemic budgeƟng challenges but rather
a mechanism to address specific criƟcal needs while maintaining fiscal accountability and
transparency. The NaƟonal Treasury values Parliament’s oversight role and will conƟnue to ensure
full compliance with legislaƟve processes.

TAX EXPENDITURE
STATEMENT
ANNEXURE B
TAX EXPENDITURE STATEMENT
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 121
INTRODUCTION
The primary aim of the tax system is to raise sufficient revenue for government spending. It can also
promote socioeconomic objectives through targeted tax exemptions, deductions or credits. Tax
expenditures are estimates of the total revenue forgone due to this preferential tax treatment. This
annexure presents government’s latest estimates of the fiscal cost of tax expenditures as well as the
methodology used to produce these estimates.
Tax expenditure documents promote transparency and accountability. They help government and
the public assess the costs, benefits and overall effectiveness of this expenditure. In 2022/23 – the
latest year for which data is available – tax expenditures were estimated at R286.6 billion or 4.2 per
cent of GDP.
TAX EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES
The estimates presented in tables B.1 and B.2 are calculated using the “revenue forgone” method.
This entails comparing actual revenue collections with the revenue that would have been collected
without the incentive in place.
The revenue forgone approach assumes that taxpayers do not change their behaviour in response
to a tax expenditure being withdrawn. However, behaviour is likely to change if an incentive is
withdrawn, so the additional revenue collected may be less than estimated.
Most of the personal income tax and corporate income tax estimates are calculated using
administrative data from the South African Revenue Service (SARS), which allows tax expenditure
estimates to be accounted for on an accrual basis.
Trends in tax expenditure: 2019/20 – 2022/23
This section uses historical data to analyse trends in tax expenditure at an aggregate level between
2019/20 and 2022/23. The numbers presented for the latest fiscal year reported in each tax
expenditure statement are generally lower than previous fiscal years because the number of
taxpayers that SARS has assessed is not close to 100 per cent. Tax expenditures remained relatively
constant as a share of nominal GDP over the period, decreasing from 4.7 per cent in 2019/20 to
4.2 per cent in 2022/23. The 2022/23 share will be more accurate in the 2026 Budget Review once
levels of assessment are higher.

Sectoral trends in tax expenditure: 2019/20 – 2022/23
The SARS tax administrative data is aligned with the Standard Industrial Classification, rather than
SARS sector codes, for the sectoral analysis.
Research and development (R&D) tax incentive (section 11D of the Income Tax Act, 1962)
The R&D tax incentive aims to encourage more private-sector companies to invest in R&D by
providing a 150 per cent deduction for expenditure on eligible scientific or technological R&D carried
out in South Africa.
Table B.1 shows the five sectors that have benefited the most from this tax incentive over the
reporting period. More than 65 per cent of the tax expenditure has supported the financial
intermediation, insurance, real estate and business services sector and the manufacturing sector.
The agricultural sector has also benefited, highlighting that this incentive encourages R&D in sectors
that are important for job creation.
Participation exemption in terms of foreign dividends and share sales (section 10B(2) of the Income
Tax Act)
To qualify for the participation exemption, a resident company (or group of companies) must hold
10 per cent or more of the total equity shares and voting rights of a company declaring a foreign
dividend. The exemption aims to encourage resident companies to repatriate dividends and prevent
economic double taxation (if dividend withholding tax is due in the foreign country, for example).
Qualifying companies are also exempt from capital gains tax on the sale of shares.
Table B.1 shows the five sectors that benefited the most between 2019/20 and 2022/23. The
reported numbers relate solely to the exempt foreign dividend element, as there is insufficient
information to publish the tax expenditure associated with the capital gains tax element.
The financial intermediation, insurance, real estate and business services sector benefits the most
– both in respect of the number of taxpayers and the monetary value of the exemption. Between
2019/20 and 2022/23, an average of 1 871 taxpayers benefited from the participation exemption
(limited to dividends).

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 131
ADDITIONAL POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENTS
Additional tax amendments proposed for the upcoming legislative cycle are set out below.
Individuals, employment and savings
Amending the definition of “remuneration proxy”
The term “remuneration proxy” as defined in the Income Tax Act (1962) is often equated with
“remuneration” as defined in the Fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act. This equivalence is
particularly relevant when the “remuneration proxy” serves as a surrogate to calculate
remuneration for the current year of assessment. However, an unintended benefit arises for certain
employees who, in the previous year of assessment, qualified for and claimed an exemption for
foreign employment income. For example, these employees may have a reduced remuneration
amount in the current year when determining the value of a domestic residential accommodation
taxable benefit. In this context, variable “A” in the formula relies on the definition of “remuneration
proxy” in section 1 of the act. It is proposed that the definition of “remuneration proxy” be amended
to include amounts exempted under section 10(1)(o)(ii) of the act.
Clarifying the inclusion of an amount assigned to a non-retirement fund member spouse under
religious tenets
In 2024, the Pension Funds Act (1956) was amended to recognise court orders pertaining to the
division of marital assets in accordance with religious tenets. However, the Income Tax Act requires
a consequential amendment to paragraph 2(1)(b)(iA) of the Second Schedule to the act to include
amounts assigned to a non-member spouse in compliance with the tenets of a religion.
Closing loopholes in the ring-fencing of assessed losses
The current application of section 20A of the Income Tax Act enables taxpayers below the maximum
marginal rate threshold to exploit the tax system by continuously offsetting losses from certain
trades against other sources of income. This creates a loophole that leads to substantial revenue
losses for the fiscus, as taxpayers receive full refunds of their employees’ tax when those losses are
allowed. It is proposed that the threshold at which ring-fencing rules apply be reviewed and
amended.
Reinstating the exemption for child maintenance payments funded from after-tax income
Child maintenance payments, which are not sourced from retirement funds, are made using aftertax income and paid to the parent or guardian living with the child. The paying party receives no tax
deduction or relief for these payments, while the recipient is taxed on the maintenance received.
Since these payments are intended to fulfil the fundamental obligation of supporting a child, taxing
them in the hands of the recipient requires reconsideration to better align with government’s social
policy objectives. It is proposed that amendments be made to exclude child maintenance payments
from the recipient’s taxable income to restore the original policy intent.

Retirement provisions
Clarifying payment of death benefits
With the enactment of the Revenue Laws Second Amendment Act (2024), a lump sum payable as a
result of the death of a member is still a retirement fund lump sum benefit. However, the definition
of “savings component” only makes provision for the treatment of the remaining balance in the
savings component on retirement and not on death. As a result, any value in the savings component
is only payable as a savings withdrawal benefit on death. It is proposed that an amendment be made
that, on the member’s death, should the nominees or dependants choose to receive a lump sum
benefit, such lump sum benefit will be considered part of the retirement fund lump sum benefit for
Income Tax Act purposes.
Business (general)
Extending the anti-avoidance rules dealing with third-party backed shares
Third-party backed share anti-avoidance rules deem the accrual or receipt of dividends from
preference shares backed by third parties through an enforcement right of the holder to be income,
except where the funds derived from the issue of these third-party backed shares are used for a
qualifying purpose. For the purposes of these specific anti-avoidance rules, an enforcement right
encompasses a right of the holder to enforce performance by another person in respect of that
preference share. Structures have been identified that consist of transactions to circumvent these
third-party backed share anti-avoidance rules. It is proposed that additional measures be considered
to address the circumvention of these anti-avoidance measures.
Refining the definition of “hybrid equity instrument”
The Income Tax Act contains anti-avoidance measures designed to address concerns of undue tax
advantages obtained through merging equity and debt features to change the nature of income.
The term “hybrid equity instrument” is broadly defined to encompass any type of share that has
essential characteristics of debt. This definition covers five different types of instruments, including
preference shares. It has come to government’s attention that the characteristics of the definition
as it relates to preference shares can be circumvented, resulting in the potential non-application of
this anti-avoidance measure. It is proposed that the definition of “hybrid equity instrument” be
revised to address the circumvention of this anti-avoidance measure.
Clarifying the ordering of set-off of balance of assessed losses and certain deductions
With effect from 2023, the set-off of balance of assessed losses is limited to 80 per cent of taxable
income for companies. Deductions for donations and transfers from policyholder funds of long-term
insurers are limited with reference to taxable income, as defined. Government is aware of certain
instances where uncertainty exists regarding the ordering of the set-off of balance of assessed losses
and deductions for donations and transfers from policyholder funds of long-term insurers. It is
proposed that amendments be introduced to clarify the ordering of these deductions in calculating
taxable income.

Corporate reorganisation rules
Clarifying the rollover relief for listed shares in an asset-for-share transaction
The Income Tax Act contains rollover rules for asset-for-share reorganisation transactions. The
provisions generally prescribe that the tax cost for assets acquired by a company in exchange for
the issue of shares in that company to the seller be equal to the same tax cost of that seller. In 2010,
a unified special rollover regime for asset-for-share reorganisations was introduced to address the
tax cost tracing problem where the relevant assets are listed shares, as the acquiring company could
not be realistically expected to know the tax cost of the target shares held by each shareholder
disposing of the listed shares (disposing shareholders). At issue is that government’s policy intent
was to specifically limit the special rollover regime relief to disposing shareholders holding less than
20 per cent of the listed shares in the target company before the transaction. It is proposed that the
legislation be amended to align with the original policy intent and that the special rollover regime
for listed shares be limited to shareholders holding less than 20 per cent of the equity shares in the
target company before the transaction.
Reviewing asset-for-share and amalgamations transactions involving collective investment schemes
According to the discussion document on the tax treatment of collective investment schemes (CISs)
published on 13 December 2024, transferring shares to a CIS without tax implications has allowed
for unintended tax avoidance during changes of shareholdings in listed companies, as the realised
gains in the shares are not taxed on transfer. The realised gains are also not taxed when the CIS
disposes of the shares as part of a corporate restructuring. It is proposed that these provisions
relating to asset-for-share transactions and amalgamations transactions be reviewed.
Clarifying the interest limitation rules
In 2021, the Income Tax Act was amended to strengthen rules that govern the limitation of interest
deductions. These rules limit interest deductions in two instances. The first is when a South African
debtor incurs interest and there is a direct or indirect controlling relationship between the debtor
and creditor, plus the interest income is not taxed in the hands of the creditor (per section 23M of
the Income Tax Act). The second is in respect of reorganisation and acquisition transactions (per
section 23N of the Income Tax Act). It has come to government’s attention that these measures
require further clarification in the following areas.
Refining and clarifying the definition of “interest” to enhance certainty
Government acknowledges the complexity surrounding the definition of “interest” in section 23M
of the act and its use in the calculation of “adjusted taxable income”. It is proposed that this
definition of “interest” only pertain to interest deductions that are tested for limitation. As a result,
taxpayers should rely on the definition of “interest” contained in section 24J of the Income Tax Act
to calculate “adjusted taxable income”.
Reviewing the carve-out for the interest limitation rules
The interest limitation rules do not apply to interest on debt in instances where the ultimate lending
institution has no controlling relationship with the debtor and if the interest charged does not
exceed the official rate of interest plus 100 basis points. It is proposed that back-to-back lending
ANNEXURE C
ADDITIONAL TAX POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS
134 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
arrangements where there is no controlling relationship between the ultimate lending institution
and the debtor also be eligible for carve-out from these rules.
Clarifying the treatment of foreign exchange differences when there is no accrual for the creditor
The interest limitation rules acknowledge foreign exchange differences on foreign exchange
instruments under section 23M(7) of the act. However, it is unclear how foreign exchange
differences should be treated when foreign exchange gains do not accrue to creditors. It is proposed
to make it clear that the objective is to first test whether the underlying debt should be limited.
Where this is the case, the foreign exchange difference thereon will also be limited.
Limiting interest deductions for reorganisation and acquisition transactions
In 2024, amendments were made to align the definition of “adjustable taxable income” and the
formula applied to limit an interest deduction in section 23N of the act with the definition of
“adjustable taxable income” and the formula applied in section 23M of the act. The effective date
for the amendments is 1 January 2027 to give the National Treasury and affected stakeholders time
to consider the impact of the proposed amendments. It is proposed that government review the
impact of the 2024 amendments during the 2025 legislative cycle with the potential for a proposal
in the 2026 Budget.
Business (financial sector)
Aligning the tax treatment of dividends with the accounting treatment by a covered person
A “covered person” (banks and brokers) is taxed in accordance with accounting principles of
International Financial Reporting Standards 9. It has come to government’s attention that covered
persons are investing in shares and receiving dividends to hedge financial liabilities like equity-linked
notes where the payments are tax deductible. To ensure consistent tax treatment, it is proposed
that dividends from these hedges be taxed to align the tax treatment of these dividends with their
financial accounting treatment.
Anomaly in the act relating to capital distributions by collective investment schemes
According to the discussion document on the tax treatment of CISs published on 13 December 2024,
since the 2009 change to tax CISs in securities according to an adjusted trust system, there has been
no clear legal rule regarding “capital distributions” to holders of participatory interests. If a CIS
portfolio in securities is liquidated, any payments at that time could be considered proceeds from
the disposal of participatory interests. However, there is no specific rule for ongoing payments from
the portfolio’s capital. It is proposed that the tax treatment of these capital distributions be
considered.
Tax treatment of first loss after capital (FLAC) instruments as defined in the Financial Sector
Regulation Act (2017)
The Reserve Bank has the authority to instruct the Prudential Authority to establish Prudential
Standards that define the features of FLAC instruments and to mandate designated institutions, such
as banks, to hold a minimum amount of FLAC instruments, as specified by the Reserve Bank under
ANNEXURE C
ADDITIONAL TAX POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 135
the Financial Sector Regulation Act, to cover all liabilities of the designated institution. It is proposed
that the tax treatment of these FLAC instruments be clarified where necessary.
International
Refining the definition of “equity shares” to cater for transfers by foreign companies
The terms “dividends” and “return of capital” are defined in section 1 of the Income Tax Act. Both
definitions refer to amounts transferred by residents. There are separate definitions for “foreign
dividends” and “foreign return of capital”. Based on the current wording of the “equity share”
definition, it seems that shares in a foreign company are not considered and cannot be classified as
equity shares. It is proposed that the definition of “equity share” be updated.
Interaction between sections 6quat and 23(m) of the Income Tax Act
Section 6quat(1C) of the Income Tax Act allows for the sum of any taxes paid or proved to be payable
to any sphere of government of any country other than South Africa to be deducted against income
when determining that person’s taxable income. Section 23(m) of the Income Tax Act, subject to
certain exclusions, prohibits deductions in relation to any remuneration received from employment.
At issue is that the list of exclusions to the application of section 23(m) does not include a reference
to the deduction contemplated in section 6quat. It is proposed that the list of exclusions
contemplated in section 23(m) be extended to include any deductions contemplated in section
6quat(1C).
Interaction of controlled foreign company rules in section 9D with section 9H
Section 9H of the Income Tax Act, also known as the exit charge, provides that when a foreign
company ceases to be a controlled foreign company (CFC), it is deemed to have disposed of all its
worldwide assets on the date immediately before the date it ceases to be a CFC. Section 9D(2A) of
the act requires that the “net income” of a CFC be calculated as if the CFC were a taxpayer and tax
resident. It has come to government’s attention that some arrangements between South African
holding companies and their foreign subsidiaries, which are CFCs, involve the CFCs acquiring all
shares in the South African holding companies without triggering an exit charge. It is proposed that
the act be amended to ensure that the exit charge is triggered in this case.
CFC rules and comparable tax exemption
South Africa has a comparable tax exemption that applies to CFCs. This exemption allows the net
income of CFCs not to be imputed under CFC rules if the tax they pay to foreign countries is at least
67.5 per cent of what they would have paid in South Africa had they been a South African tax
resident. However, the comparable tax exemption does not consider tax systems of countries that
allow a refund to certain shareholders of a foreign company for tax paid by the company declaring
the dividend. It is proposed that a tax refund to a shareholder should also be taken into account in
applying the comparable tax exemption.
Taxation of trusts and their beneficiaries
In 2023, amendments were made to the rules relating to the taxation of trusts and their beneficiaries
by limiting the flow-through principle to resident beneficiaries. It has come to government’s
ANNEXURE C
ADDITIONAL TAX POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS
136 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
attention that the interaction between sections 7 and 25B of the Income Tax Act and the tax
treatment of income and assets vested in beneficiaries of trusts could have unintended
consequences where non-residents are involved. It is proposed that these aspects be reviewed.
Refining deferral of exchange difference rules on debt between related companies
Section 24I of the Income Tax Act deals with the tax treatment of gains and losses on foreign
exchange transactions. However, rules apply for postponing the taxation of exchange differences
until the debt is realised. It is proposed that the policy be reconsidered so that deferred exchange
differences are triggered on the portion of an exchange item realised during the year of assessment.
In addition, it is proposed to clarify the classification of debt that is not recognised in the financial
statements for financial reporting purposes.
Value-added tax
Debit and credit notes relating to a going concern as per section 8(25) of the Value-Added Tax (VAT)
Act (1991)
The VAT Act only allows the vendor who acquired an enterprise as a going concern under section
11(1)(e) to issue debit and credit notes for the return of goods or services that were supplied by the
selling vendor. It is proposed that section 21(1)(d)(ii) of the VAT Act be expanded to include the
return of goods or services that were supplied by the transferor of a business as a going concern
under section 42 or 45 of the Income Tax Act, where the goods or services are returned to the
transferee.
Reviewing the scope of the intermediary provisions
Intermediaries may account for VAT on supplies made on behalf of foreign suppliers of “electronic
services” as if these supplies were made by the intermediary. This, however, does not extend to
supplies made on behalf of local suppliers. This results in the intermediary not being able to issue a
single consolidated tax invoice for these supplies to the customer. It is proposed that widening the
intermediary provisions be considered to include supplies facilitated on behalf of local suppliers.
Reviewing VAT rules dealing with documentary requirements for silver exports
The main purpose of refineries is to refine and smelt ore received from various customers, namely
depositors. In most instances, the refineries also act as agents and sell or export ore on behalf of
these depositors. Silver from more than one depositor is typically required to make up the volume
ordered for sale or export. After the refining or smelting, it is difficult to determine which depositor’s
silver is sold or exported because the silver loses its original identity during refinery and smelting.
As a result, depositors find it difficult to obtain the documentary evidence to support the application
of the zero rate on a transaction-by-transaction basis for their silver as contemplated in
paragraph (a) of the definition of “exported” in section 1(1) of the VAT Act as well as the regulations
issued in terms of section 74(1) of the VAT Act, read with paragraph (d) of the definition of
“exported” in section 1(1) of that act. It is proposed that changes be made to the VAT Act to address
this.
ANNEXURE C

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 137
Updating a portion of the Export Regulations
The wording of regulation 8(2)(e)(ii) of the “Regulations issued in terms of section 74(1) read with
paragraph (d) of the definition of ‘exported’ in section 1(1) of the VAT Act” (the Export Regulations)
seems to be causing practical difficulties in application. It is proposed that the wording of regulation
8(2)(e)(ii) be revised for ease of administration.
Reviewing the VAT treatment of testing services supplied to non-residents who are outside South
Africa at the time of the supply, where services are supplied directly in connection with movable
property situated in South Africa
Testing services supplied to non-residents, such as testing of medication or devices on patients
(generally during clinical trials) or samples in South Africa, raises a problem because, for example,
the patient also derives a benefit and section 11(2)(l)(iii) of the VAT Act will apply irrespective of the
fact that the supply is being made to a non-resident. In certain cases, the testing services may be
performed directly in respect of movable property, which is not subsequently exported, resulting in
section 11(2)(l)(ii) of the VAT Act applying despite such movable property having no commercial
value.
Although it may be argued that the results of the clinical trials are consumed offshore by nonresidents, the current wording of section 11(2)(l) of the VAT Act prohibits the application of the zero
rating on the testing services. It is proposed that changes be made to the VAT Act to address this.
Updating the regulations on the domestic reverse charge mechanism relating to valuable metal
The definition of “residue” is limited to residue derived from or incidental to a mining operation due
to concerns that the general inclusion of waste was too broad. The introduction of the de minimis
rule, however, sufficiently covers the exclusion of waste from, for example, the medical and the
electronic industries from the ambit of the regulations. Furthermore, practical difficulties arise in
distinguishing scrap derived from or incidental to a mining operation and other waste items, as gold
scrap may consist of various waste items. It is therefore proposed that the regulations be amended
to remove this limitation in the definition of “residue”.
Reviewing the definition of “insurance”
In light of the decision in the Constitutional Court matter of Capitec Bank Limited v Commissioner
for the South African Revenue Service (CCT 209/22) [2024] ZACC 1, it is proposed that the definition
of “insurance” be revised.
Clarifying the VAT treatment of temporary letting of residential properties
For ease of administration, it is proposed that the VAT treatment of the temporary letting of
residential properties under section 18D of the VAT Act and consequential sections of this act be
reviewed and updated.
Reviewing the VAT treatment of airtime vouchers supplied in South Africa for exclusive use in an
export country
The supply of airtime vouchers in South Africa through the distribution chain for a foreign
telecommunications supplier comprises two components, namely telecommunication services to be
ANNEXURE C
ADDITIONAL TAX POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS

provided outside of South Africa and distribution services of the airtime vouchers in the country.
Distributors that sell airtime vouchers that can only be used in a foreign country are charging such
supplies at the standard rate. As these vouchers are typically supplied to distributors in South Africa
or to foreign residents located in the country for consumption of telecommunication services by
such foreign residents’ family members in a foreign country, it is proposed that the VAT Act be
amended in this regard.
Carbon tax
Aligning schedule 1 of the Carbon Tax Act (2019) emission factors
The Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) approved country-specific Tier 2
emission factors for natural gas and coal fuel types to be used by data providers for estimating and
reporting stationary and non-stationary fuel combustion emissions. To align with the DFFEapproved emission factors for coal, it is proposed to change the carbon dioxide factor for subbituminous coal from 96 100 to 96 777 kgCO2/TJ and for other bituminous coal from 94 600 to
82 912 kgCO2/TJ in schedule 1 of the Carbon Tax Act. The net calorific value to be used to convert
to tonnes of emissions is 19.14 MJ/kg for sub-bituminous coal and 26.51 MJ/kg for other bituminous
coal. It is proposed to amend the carbon dioxide emission factor for natural gas from 56 100 to
55 709 kgCO2/TJ, with a net calorific value of 37.01 MJ/m3
. The proposed amendments will take
effect on 1 January 2026. Further consultations will be held with the DFFE on country-specific
emission factors and fuel types approved for specific companies for possible inclusion in the
2025 Taxation Laws Amendment Bill.
Fugitive emissions formula
Section 4(2)(b) of the Carbon Tax Act provides the formulas to be used by companies to calculate
the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emission factors for fugitive emission activities. The formulas
apply to oil, natural gas and coal mining and handling. In the 2023 and 2024 Budgets, new fugitive
emission categories for solid fuel transformation and coal to liquid fuels were added to the
schedule 1 fugitive emissions factor table. To provide clarity to taxpayers on the formula to be used
to calculate the CO2e factors for these activities, it is proposed to apply the formula for oil and
natural gas to solid fuel transformation (IPCC code 1B1C) activities, including coke and charcoal
production. A new formula will be considered for calculating the emission factors for the coal to
liquid fuel and charcoal production activities where calorific values may be required to convert
emissions to tonnes.
Sequestration deduction
Under the carbon tax, a deduction is provided for carbon dioxide sequestration in forestry
plantations. During stakeholder consultations on the 2022 Budget proposals, the industry proposed
that the sequestration deduction be extended to third-party timber sequestration – that is, informal
third parties that grow and supply timber/wood to processing mills. In 2022/23, the Paper
Manufacturers Association of South Africa developed a protocol to measure, report and verify
carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions from plantations. The DFFE reviewed and approved
the protocol in September 2024 contingent on third-party growers registering under the greenhouse
gas reporting programme, independent verification of sequestration reports, a list of third-party
ANNEXURE C
ADDITIONAL TAX POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 139
growers registered with the DFFE and assistance being provided to small-scale operators to meet
the carbon reporting and accounting requirements.
It is proposed to extend the sequestration deduction for the paper and pulp sector to third-party
timber sequestration measured and verified in line with the approved protocol effective from
1 January 2026. This provides an incentive for informal growers to produce timber and will
contribute towards economic development and the livelihoods of the producers.
Including additional carbon offset standards under the carbon tax
Under the carbon tax, carbon offset projects and credits approved under the Clean Development
Mechanism, the Gold Standard and VERRA are eligible for the carbon offset allowance. International
standards use approved methodologies to estimate the emissions removals from eligible renewable
energy, energy efficiency and afforestation, reforestation and revegetation projects. Afforestation,
reforestation and revegetation nature-based offset projects could, for example, have important
climate benefits, such as sequestering carbon and supporting biodiversity, and provide significant
social and economic benefits and opportunities for local economic development. However,
methodologies for afforestation, reforestation and revegetation projects may not be available under
current eligible offset standards. It is proposed that additional carbon offset standards be evaluated
and considered for inclusion as eligible standards for the carbon offset allowance under the carbon
tax.
Tax administration
Customs and Excise Act
Delegation of functions of customs officers and designation of persons as customs officers
It is proposed that section 3 of the Customs and Excise Act be amended to insert a provision
providing that the Commissioner may, with the concurrence of an organ of state or institution with
whom the Commission has concluded an agreement in terms of section 2(1A), delegate functions
of customs officers to persons in the service of such organ of state or institution, or designate
persons in the service of such organ of state or institution to act as customs officers for a specific
purpose. This amendment is related to the implementation of the new South African Revenue
Service (SARS) electronic traveller management system, among other things.
Customs voluntary disclosure programme
The Tax Administration Act (2011) provides for a voluntary disclosure programme but excludes
customs and excise. It is proposed that the Customs and Excise Act be amended to provide for a
customs and excise voluntary disclosure programme.
Timing of adjustment of bill of entry
It is proposed that section 40 of the Customs and Excise Act be amended in relation to the timing of
the adjustment of the bill of entry to create flexibility in respect of adjustments made in a manner
prescribed by the Commissioner. The required flexibility can be achieved by providing for the
Commissioner to also prescribe the timing for such adjustments.

140 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The Commissioner may by rule determine a different manner to adjust a bill of entry – for example,
by allowing a single consolidated document to be submitted to adjust various affected bills of entry.
This could happen in instances of transfer pricing adjustments or where invoices for bulk export
shipments are amended. In these instances, the mandatory adjustment of the affected bills of entry
cannot happen “without delay” as currently required by section 40. SARS is also reviewing how a
single document could be used to adjust various bills of entry in such instances.
Body-worn cameras
SARS is investigating issuing body-worn cameras to customs officers to promote trust, transparency
and accountability in relation to the enforcement functions performed by customs officers.
Diesel refund
The Customs and Excise Act may require amendments to facilitate the implementation of the new
diesel refund system.
Dutiability of waste derived from processing imported goods in manufacturing plants
SARS aims to consider, with the cooperation of relevant government agencies such as the
International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa, the dutiability of waste derived
from processing imported goods in a manufacturing plant to provide for relief when waste is
disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner such as recycling.
Movement of fuel products
The fuel industry in South Africa has increasingly shifted from local manufacturing to importing
refined petroleum products such as petrol, diesel, illuminating kerosene and aviation kerosene.
Companies importing fuel levy goods highlighted the challenges they encounter in moving imported
products (especially aviation kerosene) through the national multi-product pipeline. SARS proposes
to review the legislation pertaining to the fuel industry to align it with changes in this industry and
to facilitate the movement and storage of fuel products.
Income Tax Act
Clarifying the meaning of audit certificate to be issued by public benefit organisations
Section 18A of the Income Tax Act provides that a claim for a deduction for a donation made to an
organisation as specified in that section is not allowed unless supported by a receipt issued by the
organisation containing the information as prescribed in that section. The section further prescribes
that the organisation conducting mixed section 18A and non-section 18A activities must obtain and
retain an audit certificate confirming that all donations received or accrued in the year for which
receipts were issued were used solely to undertake activities covered by section 18A of the act.
Some uncertainty exists about how the term “audit certificate” must be interpreted and whether it
should bear reference to terminology contained in the Auditing Profession Act (2005). It is proposed
that the term be clarified in the context of this section.

Reviewing the Fourth Schedule to allow for one nominated employer for company group structures
and employee share scheme trusts of a group of companies
The provisions of the Fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act will be reviewed to determine if they
should be amended to allow one employer to be nominated by a group of companies, or by an
employee share scheme trust for a group of companies, to apply to be registered as the employer
on their behalf for purposes of pay-as-you-earn withholding and payment, return submissions and
IRP5 certificate generation of multiple companies in a group context or an employee share scheme
trust. This may require, among others, extending the joint and several liability principles in the
Fourth Schedule for the entities concerned.
Value-Added Tax Act
VAT disputes on the importation of goods
VAT on the importation of goods, as well as penalties or interest emanating from an import
transaction, is imposed in terms of the VAT Act. For practical administrative purposes, VAT disputes
in this context (for example, refusal to remit penalties and interest with regard to VAT on the
importation of goods) are dealt with in terms of the customs internal administrative appeals
framework provided in terms of Chapter XA of the Customs and Excise Act. However, nothing
precludes the vendor from instituting an objection and appeal under the Tax Administration Act.
This raises practical and administrative challenges as the customs and VAT disputes are interrelated
and should ideally be dealt with as part of one dispute resolution mechanism. It is proposed that
the dispute resolution framework of both acts be reviewed to determine the best way to deal with
these types of disputes.
Tax Administration Act
Trustee’s role as the representative taxpayer of the pre-insolvent person
An amendment is proposed to confirm that the liability of a trustee of an insolvent estate, in their
representative capacity, also extends to any income received or accrued to the insolvent person
prior to the sequestration of the estate.
Inspecting an enterprise that submits a voluntary VAT registration application
To curb VAT fraud and abuse, SARS implements risk-mitigating measures throughout the VAT
product life cycle, including VAT registration. When voluntary VAT registration applications are
submitted, SARS may require a site inspection to be conducted to verify that the enterprise business
address given on the application exists and the premises are conducive to conducting the activities
reflected on the application. The Tax Administration Act provides that SARS may conduct an
inspection at business premises under certain circumstances. It is proposed that its provisions or
those of the VAT Act be expanded to include inspections for this purpose.
Clarifying “bona fide inadvertent error” for purposes of understatement penalties
The concept and scope of a “bona fide inadvertent error” has proven to be contentious. This concept
is not explicitly used in similar understatement penalty frameworks, because these do not mix
purely factual tests such as “substantial understatement” with taxpayer behaviours in a single
provision. To clarify the scope of “bona fide inadvertent error”, it is proposed that “bona fide
inadvertent error” be explicitly linked with “substantial understatement”.

Tax clearance status
The interaction between the current tax compliance status system and SARS’ entity scoring model
will be reviewed to determine if synergies in approach can be achieved.
TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS
In addition to the amendments described above, the 2025 tax legislation will make various technical
corrections, which mainly cover inconsequential items – typing errors, grammar, punctuation,
numbering, incorrect cross-references, updating and removing obsolete provisions, removing
superfluous text, and incorporating regulations and commonly accepted interpretations into formal
law. Technical corrections also include changes to effective dates and the proper coordination of
transitional tax changes.
Other technical corrections relate to modifications following the implementation of the tax law.
Although tax amendments go through an intensive comment and review process, new issues arise
once the law is applied (including obvious omissions and ambiguities). These issues typically arise
when tax returns are prepared for the first time after the tax legislation is applied. These technical
corrections are limited to recent legislative amendments.

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 143
INTRODUCTION
This annexure provides a review of planned public infrastructure spending and broader
infrastructure reforms, including updates on the public-private partnership (PPP) regulatory
framework amendments and the status of major capital projects.
Government seeks to facilitate a shift in the quantity and quality of infrastructure delivery by
mobilising private-sector financing and technical expertise at scale. Several reforms are under way
to strengthen public investment management and the associated value chain. Many of these involve
pooling resources with the private sector in blended finance initiatives aimed at funding and
implementing infrastructure projects more effectively. The reforms include improving the PPP
regulatory framework, reviewing the institutional arrangements to fast-track delivery of strategic
infrastructure, enhancing infrastructure monitoring and reporting (including on PPP contingent
liabilities), and building a strong project pipeline. A comprehensive project pipeline appears at the
end of the annexure.
The difference between public-sector infrastructure, PPPs and blended finance projects
Public-sector infrastructure refers to infrastructure that is for general public use, where the resulting
service can be made available within the prescripts of legislation. A PPP is a contract between a publicsector institution and a private party, where the private party performs a function that is usually
provided by the public sector and/or uses state property by agreement. Most of the project risk
(technical, financial and operational) is transferred to the private party. The public sector pays for a full
set of services, including new infrastructure, maintenance and facilities management, through monthly
or annual payments. In instances where the public-sector asset has the potential to raise revenue –
such as a toll road or a rail link – the private party would be responsible for these services through a
user-pays PPP. In a traditional government project, the public sector pays for the capital and operating
costs, and carries the risks of cost overruns and late delivery.
In this annexure, blending is defined as the strategic use of limited funds from the fiscus to mobilise
financing from multilateral institutions, development finance institutions and the private sector to
enhance the development impact of infrastructure.
TRENDS IN PUBLIC- AND PRIVATE-SECTOR INVESTMENT
In 2023, both public- and private-sector investment increased as a percentage of GDP. Public-sector
capital investment increased from 3.8 per cent in 2022 to 4.1 per cent in 2023, while private-sector
capital investment rose from 10.3 per cent to 10.8 per cent of GDP (Figure D.1). Yet, much faster
growth is needed to expand the economy and reduce unemployment and poverty.
Over the past decade, weak growth, rising spending pressures, inefficient delivery and the financial
support provided to state-owned companies have constrained government’s ability to optimally
invest in infrastructure. Between 2013 and 2023, public-sector capital investment averaged 5.1 per
cent of GDP, while private capital investment averaged 10.9 per cent of GDP. Higher total
investment, measuring 14.9 per cent of GDP in 2023, remains well below the National Development
Plan target of 30 per cent. To reach this target, public-sector investment in infrastructure would
need to grow to 10 per cent of GDP by 2030, while private-sector investment would need to grow
to 20 per cent in 2030. Bridging the infrastructure investment gap requires developing innovative

approaches to leverage private-sector finance, making the necessary regulatory changes and
improving infrastructure planning across government to build a pipeline of projects. To unlock this
potential, government has initiated broad reforms in infrastructure provision, discussed later in the
annexure, to support economic recovery.

PUBLIC‐SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING HIGHLIGHTS
Table D.1 summarises government’s infrastructure spending plans for the next three years at
national, provincial and local government level, including state-owned companies and other public
entities. Public-sector infrastructure spending over the 2025 medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) period is estimated at R1.03 trillion. State-owned companies continue to be the largest
contributor to capital investment, spending a projected R410.9 billion over the next three years.
Provinces are expected to spend R215.9 billion on infrastructure over the same period, while
municipalities are forecast to spend R200.8 billion.
Public housing built in provinces through the human settlements development grant is expected to
total R49.2 billion. Although these assets are transferred to homeowners, this spending is a
substantial government contribution to the built environment. Spending on economic
infrastructure, mainly by state-owned companies, accounts for 81.5 per cent of the medium-term
estimate. These funds are used to expand power-generation capacity, upgrade and expand the
transport network, and improve sanitation and water services. Social services infrastructure
accounts for 15.5 per cent of the total, with the two largest sectors, health and education,
contributing 4.4 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively.
To help close the gap between available public resources and the growing infrastructure need,
government’s economic recovery plan includes immediate measures to boost investor confidence
and longer-term reforms that promote sustained economic growth. Higher and more effective
infrastructure spending is central to this plan.

SECTOR UPDATES
Water and sanitation
In the water sector, government is prioritising 11 strategic projects with an estimated value of
R139.1 billion. These projects are expected to create about 20 000 jobs during construction and
14 000 jobs during operation. About 8 000 jobs have been created to date. Details on some of the
projects are provided below.
The second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which has an estimated capital
investment of R42.1 billion, including the water delivery component for South Africa, is expected to
be completed in 2028. The Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA) has raised about R24 billion from
the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the African Development Bank and the New
Development Bank, among others, for this project. Construction is under way for the three main
contracts (the Polihali Dam, the transfer tunnel from Polihali to Katse Dam and the Senqu Bridge).
The dam and transfer tunnel are expected to be completed by June 2029. The project is estimated
to be about 40 per cent complete.
The second phase of the Mokolo-Crocodile River Water Augmentation Project has an estimated
capital investment of R12.3 billion. It is expected to be completed in 2030, providing about 75 million
cubic meters of water annually to surrounding communities. The TCTA secured funding for the

second phase from five local commercial banks (Investec Bank, Absa, Nedbank Corporate and
Investment Banking, FirstRand Bank and Standard Bank) and two local development finance
institutions (the DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation). The project was structured
around a blended finance portfolio, with an allocation from the fiscus for those components defined
as social needs and a commitment from commercial users repaying for individual off-takes.
The uMkhomazi water augmentation project has an estimated capital investment of R24 billion, and
construction is expected to be completed in 2032. The National Treasury approved an application
for R12 billion through the Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI) to improve the affordability of the
project. Credit enhancement mechanisms are being used to crowd in private-sector investment. The
TCTA is negotiating the final water user agreements and framework agreements with recipient
municipalities. Contracts for professional services providers for the 32-kilometre tunnel and the
Smithfield Dam were awarded in May 2024 and September 2024 respectively. Both have
commenced with their services.
The second phase of the Olifants River Water Resources Development Project has an estimated
capital investment of R25 billion and is expected to be completed in 2030. The Department of Water
and Sanitation has appointed Lebalelo Water User Association to implement this phase. The BFI
provided half of the funding for the pipeline from Flag Boshielo Dam to the Sekuruwe water
treatment works in Mogalakwena. Through the BFI, Phase 2D and 2F were approved for funding
over the medium term.
The Berg River-Voëlvlei Augmentation Scheme has an estimated capital investment of R1.1 billion
and is expected to be completed in 2027. Water supply agreements between the Department of
Water and Sanitation and municipal and irrigation users have been signed. The department
approved the water use licence application in December 2024. The procurement processes for the
scheme will be concluded in 2025.
The rehabilitation of the Vaalharts-Taung irrigation scheme project was on hold from 2016 until the
approval of project preparation support from the National Treasury in 2021. This led to the
completion of the masterplan in June 2023. Based on the masterplan, the estimated capital cost for
the project is R7.2 billion. The Department of Water and Sanitation and the DBSA signed the grant
agreement on 17 October 2024. Work has commenced to develop a bankable feasibility study. The
final overall project costs will be determined once the feasibility studies are concluded.
Energy
The overarching Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme has resulted in agreements
for more than 8 588 megawatts (MW) of new generation capacity, totalling more than R280 billion
in investment. To date, 6 331 MW are in operation and 2 257 MW are still under construction and
expected to become operational in 2025/26.
Seven of the 11 preferred bidders under the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer
Procurement Programme had signed agreements for projects totalling 578 MW by the end of
December 2023. Three projects were in operation (150 MW) in November 2023, and three projects
were under construction (278 MW) by the end of December 2024.

The fifth bid window of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement
Programme focused on onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) projects. Eleven projects under
the fifth bid window (1 159 MW), with investment of about R31 billion, were under construction by
the end of December 2024.
The sixth bid window resulted in the procurement of 1 000 MW of solar PV from six preferred
bidders. Two of these projects, totalling 360 MW with investments of about R6.7 billion, reached
commercial close by December 2024. The four outstanding projects are expected to reach
commercial close by April 2025. The total investment associated with these four projects is about
R9.7 billion.
The seventh bid window of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement
Programme was launched in December 2023 for 5 000 MW of new generation and storage capacity,
alongside the second bid window for 615 MW of battery storage capacity under the Battery Energy
Storage Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme and the first bid window for
2 000 MW under the Gas Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme.
Four preferred bidders (360 MW) under the first battery storage bid window reached commercial
close in December 2024, attracting investments of about R10 billion. Commercial close of the one
outstanding project (153 MW) is expected by March 2025, with investment of about R6.7 billion.
Eight preferred bidders under the second bid window were announced on 23 December 2024. The
investment associated with these projects is about R12.8 billion. The projects are expected to reach
commercial close by the second half of 2025. The third bid window was launched on 28 March 2024
for 616 MW of battery storage capacity. It closed on 29 November 2024. Bids are being evaluated
and are expected to be awarded in 2026/27.
The Department of Electricity and Energy is working on bid windows 7.5 and 8 of the Renewable
Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme, taking into consideration
mechanisms to optimise available grid capacity, system requirements and the 2019 Integrated
Resource Plan. The department mandated the Independent Power Producers Office to implement
the pilot programme under the Independent Transmission Infrastructure Procurement Programme
to involve the private sector in expanding and strengthening the country’s transmission network
and related infrastructure. A request for information was published on 12 December 2024.
The Embedded Generation Investment Programme supports projects with a total capacity of
741 MW, comprising 300 MW of solar PV and 441 MW of wind power. These committed projects
represent an investment value of R21 billion. The pipeline includes a 240 MW wind farm and solar
PV projects totalling 300 MW under development in the Western Cape and Mpumalanga.
Transport and logistics
The transport sector gazetted 20 strategic integrated projects valued at about R126 billion.

The Small Harbours Programme aims to revitalise harbours in the Western Cape and develop new
harbours in the Northern Cape, the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Infrastructure South Africa is
in the process of procuring the services of a professional service provider to develop spatial
economic development frameworks for these Tier 1 and Tier 2 small harbours. The Tier 1 harbours
are Port Nolloth, Port St Johns and Port Edward. From the initial 22 sites identified for the spatial
economic development framework under Tier 2, five sites – two in KwaZulu-Natal, two in the
Eastern Cape and one in the Northern Cape – are undergoing project development.
Under Project Ukuvuselela, the Gauteng-Eastern Cape high-capacity rail freight corridor for
automotive volumes was gazetted in December 2022. The project is a catalyst for a R16 billion
investment by Ford Motor Company SA in the City of Tshwane and will also facilitate the upgrading
of the port of Gqeberha. The project aims to stimulate the automotive industry, which has been
negatively affected by capacity constraints in the port of Durban and poor performance on the
Container Corridor rail link. The construction phase of the project will yield an estimated
10 000 short-term jobs.
The high-capacity rail freight line is an expansion of the existing SouthCor rail infrastructure, which
extends from Waltloo and Kaalfontein in Gauteng to Gqeberha through the Free State and the
Eastern Cape. The project is at the bankable feasibility stage. In conjunction with Infrastructure
South Africa, the Infrastructure Fund, DBSA and the Industrial Development Corporation, Transnet
received R2 billion from the BFI to upgrade the rail and port infrastructure.
Digital infrastructure
The digital infrastructure sector consists of four strategic integrated projects: the Space
Infrastructure Hub, the digitisation of government records, SA Connect Phase 1, and the MeerKAT
and Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project.
The national Space Infrastructure Hub is a R4.4 billion project by the South African National Space
Agency. It aims to increase the availability and use of Earth observation data. The agency received
R1.2 billion from the BFI for the first phase of the project. The funding enabled the agency to
complete the required site characterisation studies and construct a key infrastructure component
at Matjiesfontein ground station. The Matjiesfontein site is a key component of the Space
Infrastructure Hub as it will serve as a satellite tracking and telemetry site. It will also be used for
deep space communication by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as part of its
upcoming lunar exploration programme. The requirements and procurement of the outstanding
elements that form part of phase 1 are being finalised.

The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory received R1.3 billion from the BFI for the SKA datahosting infrastructure project. This funding will cover the financial gap in construction, ensuring that
the observatory can meet the required deadlines for delivering identified infrastructure elements.
The Science Processing Centre and SKA Regional Centre Buildings, the Science Operations Centre
Building and other components are at an advanced stage of the procurement process.
Agriculture and agro-processing
In partnership with multilateral development banks, the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform
and Rural Development received a R9.9 million grant from the Middle-Income Country Technical
Assistance Fund to prepare feasibility studies to attract finance to develop two agri-parks in the Free
State and the North West. These pilot studies will be used to champion the revitalisation of the Rural
Infrastructure Agri-Parks Programme and facilities to support access to fresh produce and other
markets. A PPP financial structure is being explored for the two agri-parks.
The Marine Tilapia Industry Incubator Project in the Eastern Cape aims to establish a commercial
marine tilapia industry. It was developed by the Eastern Cape Rural Development Agency and is
supported by the Eastern Cape Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform and
Infrastructure South Africa. An estimated R2.5 million has been allocated for feasibility, market
demand and cost-benefit analysis studies, and overall business case development.
Human settlements
The human settlements portfolio has 17 strategic integrated projects: six integrated residential
development programmes, nine social housing projects and two high-impact private-sector-led
developments. Together, these projects have a total investment value of R163.1 billion and will
provide housing for over 154 000 people. To date, 10 172 of the target of 154 000 housing units
have been completed. The portfolio is projected to create over 285 000 jobs during development.
To date, 39 056 short-term jobs have been created.
In collaboration with provinces and municipalities, the Department of Human Settlements expects
to deliver about 86 000 fully subsidised houses over the medium term through an allocation of
R43.5 billion to the human settlements development grant. A further R28.4 billion is allocated to the
urban settlements development grant for metropolitan municipalities to implement bulk and related
infrastructure projects.
PUBLIC-SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE REFORMS
Over the past few years, the National Treasury has led reforms to strengthen the identification and
prioritisation of projects, project planning and appraisal, funding, procurement and implementation
readiness of the infrastructure project pipeline.
The National Treasury, the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI) and the
Infrastructure Fund are undertaking complementary reforms to strengthen the infrastructure value
chain. The National Treasury is leading the review of the setup of the institutional value chain and
spearheading initiatives to crowd in private investment. The DPWI is developing the second phase

policy and regulatory obstacles to build a credible and bankable pipeline of projects. The BFI is being
strengthened to develop a pipeline of projects that can attract funding and financing, support the
use of alternative delivery models and manage fiscal exposure and risks. The Infrastructure Fund is
increasing skills and capacity in the structuring of blended finance projects, where most of the
financing will come from the private sector.
Review of infrastructure delivery ecosystem and crowding in private-sector
investment
The National Treasury is undertaking initiatives to catalyse greater private-sector participation and
improve spending and delivery outcomes. These include introducing dedicated financing
instruments to source funding from international financial institutions, development finance
institutions and others to reduce the cost of borrowing, access technical assistance and improve
accountability. As outlined in the 2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), the National
Treasury is piloting new models of funding and financing infrastructure, which are at different stages
of development, such as the infrastructure funding platform, a credit guarantee vehicle and privatesector funding for transmission infrastructure.
The review of the institutional arrangements to fast-track project planning, financial structuring to
enable early financial closure and delivery of projects is at an advanced stage. In the 2024 MTBPS,
the National Treasury indicated its intention to combine project preparation support, transaction
advice for PPP projects and ringfenced financing from government borrowing in a single structure.
This unified approach will bring together the PPP office and Capital Projects Appraisal Unit in the
Government Technical Advisory Centre and the capabilities in the Infrastructure Fund located in the
DBSA. The memorandum of agreement that will govern their operations will be signed in 2025, with
the consolidation of these functions expected to commence in the current year.
The expected outcomes are clearer institutional arrangements to deliver strategic infrastructure and
a streamlined public investment management system leading to a stronger pipeline of credible
infrastructure projects; faster, more efficient and cost-effective delivery of infrastructure; and
greater access to various forms of financing, including more private-sector investment.
Budget Facility for Infrastructure
The BFI is a multi-disciplinary facility for large infrastructure projects to be appraised, evaluated and
linked to the budget process for the allocation of resources. It brings together experts across
government to make recommendations on the technical feasibility and readiness of infrastructure
projects. By improving the planning, technical assessment, budgeting and execution of large
infrastructure projects, the BFI supports quality public investments. The facility has helped build a
pipeline of projects that have undergone rigorous technical analysis.
Since inception, there have been eight BFI windows, with R52.9 billion allocated in windows 6, 7 and
8. To improve the preparation and packaging of projects, the BFI has enabled the establishment of
ANNEXURE D

AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS UPDATE
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 151
project preparation facilities. Projects that require preparation assistance from the BFI are referred
to these facilities.
As part of the current reforms, the BFI is being reconfigured to run multiple windows. Project
submissions will be evaluated quarterly rather than annually, as is currently the case. The same
appraisal methodology will be used, but financing decisions will be separated from the budget
process to determine the most effective financing mechanism for each project. This could include
government guarantees, appropriations, PPPs or other fiscal tools. This is expected to improve
efficiency and the allocation of fiscal and project risk.
The eighth window for the 2025 Budget process piloted the reconfigured system of appraisal and
financing. Table D.2 shows the projects that have been approved for funding and execution.
Currently, infrastructure allocations in the MTEF period are only visible and assured for a three-year
period. From a risk allocation perspective, fiscal support to a blended finance project should ideally
be transparent and assured over the project life cycle.
Improving transparency in infrastructure delivery and reporting
The National Treasury extended the scope of the infrastructure reporting model from April 2021 to
include national government. The model aims to enhance transparency and uniformity by providing
project details so that infrastructure budgets can be analysed and spending can be reviewed across
all spheres of government. Substantial progress has been made towards fully institutionalising
national government reporting by the end of March 2025. The reporting process has also identified
the need for awareness and implementation of the infrastructure delivery management system in
national government. This area will be prioritised in the 2025 MTEF to enable alignment between
planning (budgeting and procurement) and implementation processes. Selected municipalities will
pilot the use of a customised infrastructure reporting model during the 2025 MTEF period before it
is rolled out to the rest of the municipalities.

Infrastructure Fund
The Infrastructure Fund’s role is to maximise the contribution of private-sector investors in blended
finance projects while facilitating early financial closure. Since its establishment, the fund has made
significant progress in supporting the financing of infrastructure projects. Since 2021, the fund has
helped package and finance 26 blended finance projects and programmes with a capital value of
R101.6 billion across the water and sanitation, human settlements, student accommodation,
transportation, health and municipal energy sectors.
Table D.3 summarises these projects and programmes. Of this, R37.1 billion has been approved
through the BFI. Private-sector contributions total an additional R53.9 billion.
The approved projects and programmes in the human settlements sector are expected to deliver
about 34 400 units of housing, water and sanitation projects will deliver about 500 000 megalitres
of water per year, and the student accommodation programme is anticipated to provide about
13 700 beds when completed. The transport projects are expected to facilitate trade between South
Africa and other countries. They include refurbishing six land ports to streamline the movement of
people and goods; increasing Cape Town Harbour’s terminal handling capacity to 1.4 million 20-foot
equivalent units to improve operational efficiency; and building 1 000 kilometres of rail network to
increase trade through automotive exports while reducing road congestion.
The Alternative Waste to Energy Treatment Technology Project will provide an alternative waste
disposal approach that reduces environmental damage while innovatively generating energy by
converting 500 000 tons of solid waste per year at a dedicated waste-to-energy facility.

PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
Implementing recommendations from the PPP review
The National Treasury is advancing the implementation of recommendations from the
comprehensive review of the PPP regulatory framework across all three spheres of government.
Recommendations are being implemented to improve the PPP policy, legal and regulatory
framework; strengthen institutional arrangements; and improve the reporting of fiscal risks and
contingent liabilities. The changes are expected to drive higher confidence and investment in PPPs
as well as greater private-sector participation.
As highlighted in the 2024 Budget, amendments were drafted to the National Treasury
Regulation 16 (NTR 16) and the Municipal PPP Regulation 309, which govern PPPs. The National
Treasury issued these amendments for public comment on 19 February 2024 and the public
commentary process closed on 15 April 2024. The National Treasury has made good progress in
addressing the recommendations related to changes in the legal and regulatory framework.
A communication will be issued in response to all public comments received on NTR 16. The
amendments to the Municipal PPP Regulation 309 require more time because of procedural
processes, including consultation with Parliament. These amendments will be finalised by June
2025.
The final amendments to NTR 16 were issued on 7 February 2025. The summary of the amendments
is as follows:
• NTR 16 rationalises the approvals for smaller projects with a threshold of R2 billion that exempts
projects from Treasury Approvals IIA and IIB.
• The PPP Advisory Unit’s roles and responsibilities have been defined in the amendments to
support institutions in the planning and procurement process for PPPs and to fast-track the
conclusion of PPP projects to reach financial close.
• The amendments provide a clear delineation of the institutional roles and responsibilities of the
PPP advisory function and the regulatory function.
• A new provision empowers national departments to establish dedicated units tasked with
adopting a programmatic approach to support PPPs on behalf of other organs of state within the
strategic sectors under their jurisdiction. The PPP Advisory Unit will collaborate closely with these
departmental units to ensure effective coordination and execution of PPP initiatives.
• The legislative amendments provide mechanisms to track, report and manage fiscal
commitments and contingent liabilities (FCCL) through the reporting requirements of Treasury
Approvals I, IIB and III.
• The provisions for granting exemptions to NTR 16 have been improved to ensure good
governance.
ANNEXURE D
PUBLIC SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE
AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS UPDATE
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 155
• The provision about applications from institutions seeking approvals for amendments to PPP
agreements has been improved and clearly explained to ensure good governance.
• The amendments include a clear framework for receiving and processing PPP unsolicited bid
proposals together with incentives to ease entry for the private sector.
The amendments are effective from 1 June 2025. This timeline has been set to allow sufficient time
for institutions to familiarise themselves with the amendments as well as the enabling FCCL and
unsolicited bid proposal guidelines that support these changes. In addition, institutions will receive
training on the new amendments before their effective date.
To complement the recently issued amendments, the National Treasury will update the PPP manual
to reflect the new amendment requirements as well as the modules recommended for revision, as
outlined in the PPP review. Additionally, sector-specific toolkits are being developed, starting with
priority sectors such as water and sanitation, tourism, electricity and accommodation. These
updates are expected to be completed in 2025/26.
The legislative changes are not sufficient in crowding in private-sector investment. The National
Treasury is working on various enabling mechanisms to support the legislative amendments. This
includes:
• Improving the policy framework: The PPP ecosystem is being reviewed as part of a larger reform
programme, as discussed above.
• Strengthening the regulatory function: The National Treasury will continue to strengthen the
capacity of its regulatory function, which oversees and approves all PPPs, as this function is
important for gatekeeping, timely approvals, transparency and fiscal oversight.
• Exploring financial support mechanisms: Further work is being done to explore options to bridge
the affordability gap for PPP projects through budget processes. Funding mechanisms and other
interventions need to be in place early to minimise delays in moving projects from contract to
financial close.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities arise when there is a potential obligation that may materialise depending on
the outcome of a future event. These liabilities are incurred if the contingency is likely to occur and
the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The materialisation of such liabilities, along
with the associated costs, can significantly impact the budgets of institutions. Therefore, it is crucial
to disclose all contingent liabilities, as they can have substantial implications for public finances.
National and provincial PPP agreements are guaranteed by the Minister of Finance. These create a
contingent liability for the national fiscus. This highlights the importance of carefully managing and
monitoring contingent liabilities to ensure fiscal stability and transparency.
The National Treasury ensures that contingent liabilities arising from contracts are acceptable and
monitors these liabilities. The National Treasury reviews and approves contingent liabilities of
national or provincial PPP projects at the Treasury Approval III stage.

PUBLIC-SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE
AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS UPDATE
156 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
The legislative amendments to NTR 16 strengthen the reporting requirements and compliance
relating to fiscal commitments and contingent liabilities.
There are various categories of contingent liabilities, depending on whether the termination is the
result of private-sector default, government default or force majeure – an event beyond the party’s
control. Compensation depends on the reason the contract ended, but termination due to
government default usually results in the greatest compensation. Table D.4 shows potential
termination amounts for national and provincial departments and public entities. Total contingent
liabilities amount to R11.4 billion for 2024/25.
Estimated contingent liabilities for PPPs that are likely to accrue to government if contracts are
terminated due to government default decreased from R6.8 billion in 2023/24 to R6.2 billion in
2024/25. This decline was expected as government continues to pay off debt and equity owed to
the private sector and as the contract terms of PPP projects end. National departments account for
the greatest exposure, amounting to R3.2 billion in 2024/25. Head office accommodation projects
and the Gautrain Rapid Rail Link project are the biggest contributors to government’s exposure to
contingent liabilities. Government manages the risk emanating from PPP contingent liabilities by
closely monitoring each party’s performance against their contractual obligations and enforcing
regulatory requirements.
Improving the quantification of fiscal risks and contingent liabilities
The recommendations from the PPP review have underscored the need to enhance the reporting
and monitoring of FCCL. This requirement has been reinforced through the revised legislative
amendments to NTR 16, which mandate institutions to report on fiscal risks and contingent liabilities
exposure.
Increased private-sector participation highlights the need for the National Treasury to better
understand and manage fiscal risks associated with externally financed public projects. Effectively
identifying, assessing, managing and reporting fiscal risks and contingent liabilities have become
essential for designing new project financing methods and monitoring and reporting on existing
projects.
In response to this, the National Treasury will issue FCCL guidelines that establish a shared
understanding of the methodology for reporting fiscal risks, commitments and contingent liabilities.
Additionally, the National Treasury will provide the necessary templates and training to ensure that

institutions are equipped to regularly report on their financial commitments and contingent
liabilities arising from PPP projects.
PPP projects going to the market
There are 35 PPP projects at different stages of development: 11 projects are in the inception phase,
11 are in the feasibility study phase and 13 are in the procurement stage. This distribution highlights
the ongoing interest and commitment of public-sector institutions in the PPP market. Given budget
constraints, the PPP model offers a viable alternative for these institutions to access private-sector
financing and expertise.
Additionally, the amendments to the PPP regulatory framework will enable greater private-sector
participation in public-sector infrastructure projects by reducing the procedural complexity in
implementing PPPs. The creation of two pathways for PPPs, one for high-value projects and a
simplified version for low-value projects, will incentivise the commencement of smaller PPP
projects.
Brief details on some notable projects are outlined below.
Redevelopment of Ports of Entry Project
The R9.1 billion project aims to reduce delays experienced by passengers and vehicles at six inland
borders that South Africa shares with its neighbouring countries. This will facilitate the efficient
movement of goods to improve regional trade. The Department of Home Affairs will enter into a
PPP agreement with a private party to design, build, operate and finance the redevelopment of the
identified ports of entry.
The Department of Home Affairs has made significant progress in the procurement process, with
the request for proposals submission period now closed. Both the department and the Border
Management Authority are evaluating the submissions, with support from various stakeholders
such as the National Treasury, the DBSA, the Infrastructure Fund and Infrastructure South Africa.
Gautrain Rapid Rail Link System
The Gautrain Rapid Rail Link System is an 80-kilometre rapid rail system in Gauteng, linking the cities
of Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni. The current Gautrain concession ends in March 2026.
The provincial government intends to implement new arrangements to ensure continuity of the
current service while improving the quality, affordability, accessibility and sustainability of the
system.
This project is at the evaluation stage and is expected to reach the stage of application for Treasury
Approval IIB in 2025/26. The project should reach financial closure towards the end of this financial
year.
Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital

the provincial government is undertaking a new PPP arrangement to ensure continuity of the
current service while making improvements to the system. The project reached financial closure in
2024/25, and the new PPP agreement was signed on 28 May 2024. The project is now in its
implementation stage.
Government Precincts
The R18.1 billion Salvokop Government Precinct is a mixed-use development that includes the
construction of offices for four national government departments in Pretoria’s inner city. Four PPP
projects are registered for this precinct, each at different stages of development. These include
Home Affairs at the Treasury Approval I stage, Correctional Services and Social Development at the
feasibility study stage, and Higher Education at the inception stage.
The subsequent phases will include other commercial uses by the private sector and mixed typology
housing. The government precinct will be supported by other land uses, including residential, office,
commercial, retail, recreational and services.

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 163
This annexure reports on steps to strengthen South Africa’s framework to combat money
laundering, the financing of terrorism and other financial crimes; reforms to support greater
financial inclusion; measures to enhance climate-resilient investment; and other initiatives.
BUILDING CAPABILITY TO FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIMES AND EXIT THE GREY
LIST
In February 2023, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) put South Africa on its “grey list” due to
deficiencies in technical compliance and effectiveness of the country’s system to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. This grey listing followed the publication of the
2021 mutual evaluation report, in which South Africa was identified as non-compliant with 20 of the
40 FATF recommendations and deficient in all 11 measures of the effectiveness of the system. In
response, government developed a strategy to build a financial system that is less vulnerable to
abuse and where abuses are effectively prosecuted. This involves both legislative and regulatory
changes, as well as improvements in the implementation and application of these laws and
regulations.
Progress on technical compliance
At its October 2024 plenary, the FATF approved the upgrade of South Africa’s compliance. South
Africa now complies or largely complies with 37 of the 40 FATF recommendations, while one
recommendation was deemed to be inapplicable.
The country is deemed to partially comply with the two outstanding recommendations, which relate
to non-profit organisations and cash couriers. Meeting the outstanding recommendations does not
affect the process for the country to exit the FATF grey list, as grey listing is a consequence of the
assessment of the extent to which a country’s anti-money laundering laws and frameworks are
applied effectively. Complying with 37 of 39 applicable recommendations positions South Africa well
for the 2026/27 mutual evaluation assessment. Additional legislation will be introduced in 2025 to
improve the extent of compliance with the FATF recommendations.
Progress on effectiveness
Government continues to address the 22 action items in the action plan agreed with the FATF. Once
all items have been implemented and the improvements deemed sustainable, the FATF will
reconsider the country’s grey listing. South Africa provides a progress report every four months. The
latest draft progress report was submitted in March 2025 and will be finalised at the June 2025 FATF
plenary.
The February 2025 plenary confirmed that two action items remain. These relate to demonstrating
a sustained increase in the investigation and prosecution of complex money laundering and terror
financing. South Africa is working to address both outstanding action items by June 2025 to exit grey
listing by October 2025.

Cross-border remittances
In line with the FATF recommendations, the existing policy on cross-border remittances will be
expanded to include informal money value transfer services. This will help to stem illicit financial
flows as part of the fight against financial crimes.
FINANCIAL INNOVATION TO IMPROVE COMPETITION AND INCLUSION
Crypto asset policy
The Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group published a position paper on regulating crypto
assets in June 2021. The group continues its analytical work to understand the applicable use cases
of stablecoins and to recommend an appropriate policy and regulatory response. The group recently
finalised a diagnostic of the domestic stablecoin landscape, which will be published in 2025. In
addition, the group aims to finalise a set of regulatory recommendations in line with relevant
international standards, including a framework for cross-border crypto asset transactions, which will
be published for public consultation during 2025.
Artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector
In 2025, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) in collaboration with the Prudential Authority
will publish a market study on the adoption and use of AI in South Africa’s financial sector.
Integrating AI into the financial sector presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in
the areas of consumer protection, market conduct and financial soundness. Despite AI’s potential
to enhance efficiency and innovation, there is a significant gap in understanding its current adoption
and impact, and the associated regulatory challenges. The market study aims to explore the
landscape of AI within the financial industry, focusing on how AI technologies affect consumer
protection, influence market conduct and affect financial stability. The research will help to ensure
that AI is used ethically, responsibly and effectively while safeguarding the integrity and soundness
of the financial sector.
NATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEM REFORMS
The Reserve Bank and the National Treasury are working on reforms aimed at strengthening the
legal and regulatory framework of the national payment system. These efforts aim to promote
stability, transparency, integrity and safety, while also supporting financial inclusion, competition
and the prevention of financial crime. Additionally, these efforts will contribute to achieving the
objectives of the Digital Payments Roadmap, national payment system financial inclusion initiatives
and the National Payment System Framework and Strategy: Vision 2025.

ANNEXURE E
FINANCIAL SECTOR UPDATE
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 165
National Payment System Bill
The National Treasury is carving out the amendments to the National Payment System Act (1998)
from the schedule of the Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill into a standalone bill for the national
payment system due to the length of the proposed amendments. Alignment will be maintained with
the draft Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill and the Financial Sector Regulation Act (2017).
Given their interdependencies, it is envisaged that the two bills will be processed concurrently, to
the extent feasible. The bills are anticipated to be tabled in Parliament during 2025.
Enabling broader access to the national payment system
The Reserve Bank is collaborating with the Prudential Authority to expedite non-bank access to the
national payment system through a notice exempting certain payment activities from the business
of a bank in the Banks Act (1990), such as mobile money and electronic fund transfers. The
exemption notice will be accompanied by a regulatory framework to ensure that entities providing
these exempted payment activities are effectively regulated, thereby mitigating risks within the
national payment system and the broader financial system. Both the exemption notice and the
regulatory framework will be published for public consultation in the first quarter of 2025.
Review of the payment ecosystem
In 2018, the Reserve Bank published Vision 2025 to enhance the safety, efficiency and accessibility
of the national payment system. This framework aimed to facilitate competition and reduce risks by
leveraging technological developments to expand the availability of digital payment services to all
sectors of society while meeting domestic, regional and international requirements.
Although progress has been made in achieving the goals of Vision 2025, competing priorities and
the rapidly changing payments landscape have meant that some key initiatives have not achieved
the desired results within expected timeframes. For this reason, the Reserve Bank initiated the
Payments Ecosystem Modernisation Programme as a centrally coordinated effort to ensure rapid
transformation of the payment ecosystem. The Reserve Bank will lead the transformation while
working closely with both public- and private-sector stakeholders.
Ensuring universal access to and adoption of digital payments will require a holistic approach,
combining continued innovation, policy reforms and enhanced coordination among stakeholders.
The programme aims to transform the payment ecosystem through the introduction of several
common capabilities, premised on the establishment of a centralised national payments utility to
deliver various components required for modernisation. The key components to be delivered in the
next five years include:
• A fit-for-purpose legal and regulatory framework, including risk management and policy
coordination.
• A national payments utility housing the common services to be used by the payments
industry, supported by a suitable governance model to enable its efficient functioning.
ANNEXURE E

166 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
• Foundational capabilities to support the safe and efficient functioning of the payment
ecosystem, including a digital financial identity, an electronic know-your-customer registry
and e-signing capabilities.
• A fast and efficient low-cost payment system.
• Interoperability standards and rules for all participants in the payment ecosystem.
• Centralised fraud management and intelligence capabilities to improve monitoring and
support improved decision-making.
• Availability of low-cost, accessible stores of value (assets that can be saved, retrieved and
exchanged in the future without significantly losing their worth) to facilitate digital
transactions.
• A modernised, safe and efficient real-time gross settlement system.
• An awareness and education campaign of the offerings in the future payment ecosystem
that targets all participants and consumers.
The Reserve Bank has initiated a process to formulate a new payments vision and strategy to follow
on from Vision 2025. Various stakeholders are being engaged for input. The Reserve Bank intends
to finalise the new vision in the latter part of 2025, with implementation starting in 2026.
RESPONDING TO CLIMATE RISKS AND WORKING TOWARDS NET ZERO
In the first quarter of 2025, the FSCA will run a pilot with key financial institutions to encourage
greater adoption of the South African Green Finance Taxonomy. The FSCA will release the results of
the pilot later in 2025.
The FSCA is also expected to release further information on climate disclosure requirements,
building on the guidance note for banks and insurance companies issued by the Prudential Authority
in 2024, and expanding it to a broader range of financial institutions.
RETIREMENT REFORM
The two-pot system
During the public comment process of the two-pot retirement reform, several reform areas were
identified to be addressed later. This included the matter of withdrawals from the retirement
portion if one is retrenched and has no alternative source of income.
The two-pot retirement system splits contributions into a “savings component” and a “retirement
component”, with the latter fully preserved until retirement. Although an individual who is
retrenched can transfer their retirement benefits to another fund, they cannot withdraw any
portion of the retirement component until they reach retirement age.
During the public comment process, government received requests to allow access to the
retirement component when an individual is retrenched. The restructuring required for this
proposed reform is complex and therefore forms part of the second phase of the two-pot reforms.
Government is beginning work and discussions on measures that may allow access to the retirement
ANNEXURE E

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 167
component if an individual has been retrenched and is in financial distress. Strict conditions will
apply to this access. They may include proof that the individual has no alternative source of income
after a period of time, such as payments from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, and limiting
access to a percentage of income rather than a cash lump sum. The National Treasury will engage
stakeholders, including labour and industry, once the research is concluded.
Unclaimed assets
In September 2022, the FSCA published a paper on unclaimed assets across the financial sector,
titled A Framework for Unclaimed Financial Assets in South Africa. Following responses to and
consultation on the recommendations put forward in the paper, the FSCA published a response
document on the paper in March 2024. The National Treasury and the FSCA will work with industry
to develop the recommendations from these papers, including a framework to manage unclaimed
assets and the establishment of a central unclaimed assets fund.
FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND THE OMBUD SYSTEM
The National Treasury will develop a national strategy on financial inclusion in 2025 based on the
policy paper An Inclusive Financial Sector for All, which Cabinet approved in 2023.
The National Treasury is reforming the financial sector ombud system to make it simpler, accessible,
comprehensive, efficient and effective. As part of reforms, a National Financial Ombud Scheme was
established and began operating on 1 March 2024 after being granted recognition by the Ombud
Council. The National Financial Ombud is an umbrella financial services ombud scheme formed by
the amalgamation of four ombud schemes: the offices of the Banking Ombud; the Credit Ombud;
the office of the Long-Term Insurance Ombud; and the Short-Term Insurance Ombudsman.
CONDUCT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BILL
The National Treasury is finalising the Conduct of Financial Institutions Bill together with
comprehensive amendments to the Financial Sector Regulation Act and the Pension Funds Act
(1956) and repealing various financial sector laws (conduct focused). The bill will streamline and
harmonise the legal landscape that financial institutions operate within and provide a single, holistic
legal framework for market conduct regulation in South Africa that is consistently applied to all
financial institutions.
The bill has been published twice for public consultation, discussed at several workshops and revised
to address the comments received. The final draft of the bill is awaiting certification from the Office
of the Chief State Law Adviser, whereafter it will be submitted to Cabinet for approval to be tabled
in Parliament.
The FSCA is preparing for the bill’s implementation, as will be explained in more detail in its 2025 3-
Year Regulation Plan. The FSCA has already started informal engagements on some of the regulatory
frameworks it intends to make once the bill is passed, and these will continue over the next budget
period.

MEASURES TO BOOST LONG‐TERM INVESTMENT
Capital flows management framework
The 2024 Budget Review indicated that research will be undertaken to investigate the impact of
recent reforms to modernise the foreign-exchange system and in turn promote trade and
investment. As part of this research, the International Monetary Fund conducted a technical review
of the increase and harmonisation of foreign exposure limits for institutional investors to 45 per cent
in 2022. The draft review stated that the increase could have been implemented in a more
transparent and phased manner, but the depth of South African financial markets meant that capital
outflows could be absorbed without significant impact on the exchange rate and bond prices. The
review recommended that the institutional limit not be reduced from 45 per cent as the
reputational, implementation and administrative costs would outweigh any potential benefits.
Promoting trade
To support increased trade, Authorised Dealers may allow resident agricultural commodity
producers with firm commitments to hedge their foreign exposures on foreign commodity
exchanges, provided they produce suitable documentary evidence and report to the Financial
Surveillance Department of the Reserve Bank.
Travel allowance
At present, unused foreign currency must be sold to either an Authorised Dealer or an Authorised
Dealer in foreign exchange with limited authority within 30 days of the traveller’s return to South
Africa. Alternatively, going forward, the traveller may deposit unused foreign currency into a foreign
currency account at an Authorised Dealer within 30 days of their return.
SUPPORTING INTEGRITY, EFFICIENCY AND COMPETITION IN CAPITAL
MARKETS
Capital markets play a critical role in supporting productivity by providing access to much-needed
funding by bringing together capital providers (investors and lenders) and seekers (issuers and
borrowers). The ease of access to capital markets creates incentives for providers to earn
competitive returns and for seekers to fund new projects and company operations, ultimately
sustaining and creating jobs.
Reviewing legislation to align with global best practice
Aligning South Africa’s legal framework with international standards makes it easier for global
participants to engage with the domestic market. It facilitates smoother integration with global
capital markets, enabling better access to foreign capital and efficient cross-border investments and
transactions. It also reduces the perception of legal and regulatory risk, thereby enhancing investor
confidence in South Africa as a stable and reliable destination for financial activities and
investments.
The Financial Markets Act (2012) is the regulatory foundation of South Africa’s capital markets.
Various reviews have taken place, culminating in the publication in 2020 of the National Treasury
ANNEXURE E
FINANCIAL SECTOR UPDATE
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 169
policy proposal paper Building Competitive Financial Markets for Innovation and Growth – A Work
Programme for Structural Reforms to South Africa’s Financial Markets. Government proposes
amendments to the act that will give effect to several of the proposals in the paper and final report;
for example, enabling new forms of trading platforms, like multilateral trading facilities, with
sufficient safeguards. The amendments also propose declaring foreign currency as a financial asset
to enable conduct oversight on currency trading. The amendments are expected to be published for
comment in 2025.
Standard to support the conduct of market infrastructures
South Africa has multiple exchanges and a few other market infrastructures, such as central
securities depositories. This has necessitated the review of interoperability arrangements in the
market. In 2020, the FSCA consulted on the draft Conduct Standard for Exchanges, and in the 2024
consultation phase, this was expanded to all market infrastructures. Further engagements and work
focused on finalising this conduct standard will take place this year.
The transition from JIBAR to ZARONIA
Major global financial markets have been reviewing their benchmark rates following their
manipulation in recent years. For example, in the United Kingdom, the London InterBank Offered
Rate has been replaced by the Sterling Overnight Index Average. South Africa has embarked on a
similar journey, with work now completed to replace the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate
(JIBAR) with the South African Rand Overnight Index Average (ZARONIA). ZARONIA offers a major
advantage in that it uses previous actual transactions to set the average rate. The National Treasury
is considering measures to enable the smooth transition to ZARONIA, including primary legislation
to enable safe harbour provisions that provide sufficient protection for old and existing derivative
contracts.
G20 FINANCE TRACK
The overall vision of South Africa’s G20 Presidency is to enhance solidarity through unified effort
and cooperation among nations, and promote equality through the fair treatment and advancement
of all people.
The National Treasury and the Reserve Bank, with support from the FSCA, will lead the Finance Track
during South Africa’s Presidency. The technical groups aim to address the following key financial
sector issues during the year:
• The International Financial Architecture Working Group will focus on reinforcing multilateral
development banks, enhancing debt sustainability, strengthening the global financial safety
net and strengthening financial resilience through robust capital flows.
• The Framework Working Group will prioritise building global economic resilience and
monitoring the risks to growth from macroeconomic imbalances, fragmentation, inflation and
debt; improving macroeconomic conditions and structural reform for the green transition;
and boosting productivity growth in the context of AI, demographic change and migration.
ANNEXURE E
FINANCIAL SECTOR UPDATE
170 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
• The Infrastructure Working Group will focus on developing an investable infrastructure
pipeline, scaling up sustainable infrastructure through blended finance approaches and
delivering cross-border infrastructure for regional development.
• The Sustainable Finance Working Group will focus on strengthening the global sustainable
finance architecture, scaling up financing for adaptation and a just transition, and unlocking
the financing potential of carbon markets.
• The Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion will focus on moving from access to usage of
financial products and services, particularly among women, youth and small, medium and
micro enterprises.
Other financial and taxation priorities
Finance ministers and central bank governors will also discuss financial sector issues, with a focus
on financial regulations relating to cross-border payments, AI and crypto assets. The FSCA aims to
convene a roundtable about AI in the financial sector with stakeholders from Africa and the rest of
the world alongside the G20 programme of events. The aim is to promote international dialogue on
conduct and consumer protection issues associated with AI.
The G20 has made notable progress in addressing global tax evasion and tax avoidance, including
the implementation of the global 15 per cent effective minimum tax by over 50 countries. In 2025,
the international taxation agenda will focus on assessing progress and moving forward with the twopillar tax reform, supporting effective revenue collection, addressing inequalities in taxing high net
worth individuals and improving tax certainty.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The statistical tables present details of the main budget; consolidated national, provincial and social
security funds expenditure; consolidated government revenue and expenditure; consolidated
government revenue, expenditure and financing; total government debt; and net loan debt,
provisions and contingent liabilities.
The tables are categorised according to government levels, from the main budget to the
consolidated government account. The main budget consists of National Revenue Fund receipts,
expenditure either voted by Parliament or allocated by statutory appropriation, and deficit
financing. This is the national budget, including transfers to other spheres of government.
Consolidated national, provincial and social security funds expenditure consists of the main
(national) budget, and the provincial and the social security funds’ budgets or expenditure. These
budgets are aggregated and transfers between the three spheres of government are netted out to
arrive at a total consolidated expenditure figure. The consolidated government revenue,
expenditure and financing budget includes national, provincial and social security funds, the
Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) Fund and national public entities. This is
referred to as the consolidated budget.
While government revenues are concentrated at a national level, a large proportion of expenditure
has shifted to the provinces since 1994. Equitable share transfers to the nine provinces are included
as a government statutory commitment on the National Treasury vote. In contrast, the local
government equitable share is appropriated on the vote of the Department of Cooperative
Governance. The consolidated government account consists of all the activities of the national and
provincial governments and includes most of the listed public entities. The consolidation also
includes several national government business enterprises.
Since more than 50 per cent of total national expenditure on the 2025/26 main budget consists of
transfer payments to other levels of general government, economic and functional classifications of
national budget expenditure are not comprehensive. For analysis, it would be preferable to present
economic and functional classifications of general government expenditure, but this would require
information on expenditure at all levels of general government, its financing through revenue,
balances brought forward and transfer payments (mainly from the national budget). This
information is not readily available to the local government. Historical data on general government
STATISTICAL ANNEXURE

finances is, however, published by the Reserve Bank in its Quarterly Bulletin and by Statistics South
Africa.
Change in recording of extraordinary receipts and payments in the budget
tables
Since 2014, the consolidated government account has been presented in a more transparent format
in line with the International Monetary Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (2014). This
format provides details of operating activities, capital and infrastructure investment, as well as
transactions in financial assets and liabilities. The calculation of the budget balance includes all
government transactions. Previously, extraordinary receipts and payments were added to the
budget deficit to calculate government’s net borrowing requirement. In the new format, there is no
longer a difference between the budget balance and the net borrowing requirement. These
transactions are now referred to as National Revenue Fund receipts and payments.
Treatment of foreign grants to the RDP Fund
All international technical assistance and other RDP-related grants are paid to the RDP Fund account,
which is separated from government accounts. Departments incur expenditure on RDP-related
projects through direct requisitions from this account. However, disbursements of foreign grants
and technical assistance are included in the consolidated national and provincial expenditure
estimates in Tables 5 and 6, and the consolidated government expenditure in Table 7.
Adjustments due to transactions in government debt
As part of the state’s active management of its debt portfolio, government bonds are repurchased
or switched into new bonds. In the process, government may make a capital profit, which is a book
entry change in the bond discount. This capital profit does not represent actual cash flow and is
regarded as a “book profit”, which lowers the outstanding debt.
A premium may also be accrued, or payable, in managing the debt portfolio or when entering into
new loans. Under the new format, premiums paid or received are now classified as receipts and
payments of the National Revenue Fund, rather than being categorised as extraordinary receipts
and payments.
Sources of information
The information in Tables 1 to 11 on national and provincial government and public entity finances
is obtained from the following sources:
• Reports of the Auditor-General on the Appropriation and Miscellaneous Accounts
• Printed estimates of revenue and expenditure for the national and provincial budgets
• The Reserve Bank
• The South African Revenue Service (SARS)
• Monthly press releases from the National Treasury, published in terms of section 32 of the Public
Finance Management Act (1999).

NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 191
Main budget: revenue, expenditure, budget balance and financing (Table 1)
Table 1 summarises the main budget balances since 2018/19 and medium-term estimates to
2027/28. In line with the economic reporting format introduced in 2009, the revenue classification
shows departmental sales of capital assets separately.
Appropriations by vote are divided into current payments, transfers and subsidies, payments for
capital assets and payments for financial assets. Both current and capital transfers are included in
transfers and subsidies, in line with the economic reporting format’s requirements.
Repayments of loans and advances, which were previously shown as negative expenditure, have
been reclassified as revenue. The national budget deficit (negative budget balance) is due to a higher
increase in expenditure relative to the revenue collected over the same period.
The Eskom debt-relief arrangement outlines the financial support available to Eskom. This support
takes the form of an interest-bearing loan and is classified as part of financing. In 2025/26,
government plans to assume a portion of Eskom’s debt by converting certain debt instruments into
government debt.
The Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account (GFECRA) settlement arrangement is
recorded as a return on an investment (which is a balance sheet transaction) and not as government
revenue. The settlement is set aside to reduce government’s borrowing requirement and is shown
separately as part of the calculation of national government’s gross borrowing requirement.
The deficit figures presented in this table differ from those presented in budgets before 1995/96
because several items that were previously regarded as “below-the-line” expenditure have been
included in total expenditure. In addition, revaluations of foreign loan obligations are excluded from
expenditure, in keeping with international practice.
Under the “financing” item, domestic short-term loans include net transactions in Treasury bills and
borrowing from the Corporation for Public Deposits. Long-term loans include all transactions in
domestic government bonds and foreign loans (new loan issues, repayments on maturity, buybacks,
switches and reverse purchase transactions).
Main budget: estimates of national revenue (Tables 2 and 3)
Table 2 presents a summary of revenue, and the details are set out in Table 3. Main budget revenue
collections are recorded on an adjusted cash basis as the revenue is recorded in the SARS ledgers.
Tax revenue is classified according to standard international categories and departmental receipts
according to the economic reporting format’s requirements.
In Table 3, a large amount of data cannot be reclassified to align with the economic reporting format
because departments capture these transactions in their ledgers as miscellaneous receipts.
STATISTICAL ANNEXURE
192 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Main budget: expenditure defrayed from the National Revenue Fund by vote
(Table 4)
Table 4 contains estimates of expenditure on national budget votes for the period 2021/22 to
2027/28. In 2024/25, amounts included in the budget estimate, the adjusted appropriation and the
revised estimate on each vote are shown. Historical data has been adjusted to account for function
shifts between departments. As a result, the figures presented for some departments may differ
from their financial statements. Total expenditure, however, is not influenced by these changes.
Consolidated national, provincial and social security funds expenditure
(Tables 5 and 6)
Tables 5 and 6 show the economic and functional classification of payments for the consolidated
national and provincial government and social security funds, including the Unemployment
Insurance Fund, the Road Accident Fund and the Compensation Fund. Provincial expenditure
estimates are preliminary because their budgets are tabled after the national budget. As such, these
estimates are subject to change before being tabled in provincial legislatures.
The functional classification
The functional classification in this annexure is aligned with the classification of government
functions set out in the Government Finance Statistics Manual. The historical data published in these
tables has been reclassified accordingly. Chapter 5 of the Budget Review, which sets out the
medium-term expenditure framework, outlines the budget allocations across these function groups.
To support this approach, data at programme and entity level is aggregated into spending
categories, which provides for a higher level of aggregation than in the functional classification. For
example, functional classification tables include local development and social infrastructure as
distinct functions. The fiscal statistics are an outcome of the budget process and can only be used
as a guide to categorise expenditure for budgeting purposes.
Some of the most important differences between the key spending categories presented in Chapter
5 and the more detailed functional classification presented in the statistical tables are as follows:
• Learning and culture: Expenditure in this category includes spending related to school and
tertiary education, as well as arts, culture, sport and recreation. In the statistical tables, this
expenditure is included as part of either the education or recreation, culture and religion
functions.
• Economic development: Expenditure related to innovation, science and technology is included in
the economic development function group, while in the statistical tables it is classified as
research and development according to the function to which it relates.
• Peace and security: This includes expenditure by defence, police, justice and home affairs. In the
statistical tables, the bulk of this expenditure is included in the public order and safety function,
with home affairs split between general public services and public order and safety.
STATISTICAL ANNEXURE
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 193
• General public services: In the key spending categories, transfers made to international
organisations are classified within the category of the paying department. In the statistical tables,
they are classified under general public services.
Consolidated government revenue and expenditure (Tables 7 and 8)
Tables 7 and 8 show the economic and functional classification of payments for the consolidated
government budget. This consists of the consolidated national, provincial and social security figures
presented in Tables 5 and 6, combined with general government entities, as well as some
government business enterprises.
The government budget consolidation includes all entities controlled and mainly financed by
government revenue, where such revenue is defined as either taxes, levies and administrative or
service fees prescribed by government, or direct budgetary support in the form of transfer
payments. This consolidation also includes several government business enterprises, based on the
principle that they either sell most of their goods and services to government institutions or
departments at regulated prices, and are therefore not businesses in the true sense of the word, or
they are directly involved in infrastructure financing and development.
Accordingly, state-owned entities are broadly identified as one of the following:
• Enterprises that sell mainly to government departments or institutions, that have no clear
competitors and whose prices are therefore not clearly market-related.
• Science councils that conduct research or fulfil a regulatory or advisory function, with
government-determined regulatory or administration fees.
• Government-regulated businesses that are primarily financed by a dedicated tax, administration
fee or levy (the level of which is dictated by government), or that are directly involved in the
maintenance or extension of critical infrastructure.
To present consolidated accounts, all units use the same accounting standards and policies. The
format of the accounts, terminology used, classification, transaction coverage and accounting base
(cash or accrual) must be the same. In this respect, the consolidated government budget is prepared
on an adjusted cash basis of accounting. This is not strictly comparable to the financial information
published in the consolidated financial statements, which has two components – a consolidation of
departments using the modified cash basis of accounting and a separate consolidation of public
entities that apply the accrual basis of accounting.
All transactions that occur between units being consolidated are eliminated. A transaction of one
unit is matched with the same transaction recorded for the second unit and both transactions are
eliminated from the consolidation. For example, if a public entity sells a service to a government
department and data for the two units is being consolidated, neither the sale nor the purchase of
the service is reported. In this way, only transactions between government and non-government
entities are recorded, without inflating total government revenue as a result of internal transactions.
STATISTICAL ANNEXURE
194 | NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW
Not all intra-entity transactions are eliminated, however, because they are not always identifiable
in the accounting systems of government and many of its agencies. Only those that can be identified
have been eliminated. These broadly include:
• Transactions involving transfers from one government unit to another, including transfers made
by national departments to public entities and transfers between public entities (such as Water
Trading Entity transfers to water boards).
• Purchases of goods and services from other government units included in the consolidation (such
as transactions between the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority, water boards and the Water
Trading Entity).
As data collection and recording procedures for transactions improve, additional intra-entity
transactions will be identified and removed from the consolidated government budget.
A total of 162 national and provincial departments and 195 entities are included in
the 2025 consolidated government budget. The National Treasury is committed to presenting a
comprehensive consolidation of the entire general government over time. Considerable work has
been done to align the local government accounts with national and provincial accounts. A
classification reporting framework has been developed for municipalities as a first step towards the
consolidation of the financial information of all three spheres of government.
Consolidated government revenue, expenditure and financing (Table 9)
Table 9 presents the government account, which distinguishes between government’s operating
activities and its plans to invest in capital and infrastructure.
The balance on the operating account shows the outcome of government’s operating activities,
which is a measure of the cost of ongoing operations. It is calculated as the difference between
current revenue and current expenditure, and the resulting balance shows how much government
must borrow to run its operations. The current balance demonstrates the sustainability of
government operations.
Capital investment activities are presented in the capital account. Government’s capital financing
requirement is the outcome of this account, which is calculated as the difference between capital
revenue and capital expenditure. This account will mainly be in deficit due to continuous investment
in infrastructure and substantial capital outlays.
Total debt of government (Table 10)
Table 10 shows the major components of government debt. Net loan debt consists of total domestic
and foreign debt less the cash balances of the National Revenue Fund. The balances on the Gold and
Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account, which represent net revaluation profits and losses
incurred on gold and foreign exchange transactions, are also disclosed.
STATISTICAL ANNEXURE
NATIONAL TREASURY 2025 BUDGET REVIEW | 195
Net loan debt, provisions and contingent liabilities (Table 11)
Provisions are liabilities with uncertain payment dates or amounts. The provisions for multilateral
institutions are the unpaid portion of government’s subscriptions to these institutions, which are
payable on request. Contingent liabilities are obligations that only result in expenditure when an
uncertain future event occurs. Both explicit and implicit contingent liabilities are disclosed. Implicit
contingent liabilities are mostly the actuarial deficits of social security funds, while explicit
contingent liabilities are mostly guarantees for state-owned companies, public-private partnership
projects and the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. In the
case of guarantees for state-owned companies, the exposure disclosed is the amount borrowed
against a guarantee, any related revaluation adjustments due to the inflation rate and/or exchange
rate movements, and any related interest on this amount, if guaranteed. The National Treasury
published detailed information on provisions and contingent liabilities in the annual consolidated
financial statements of national departments.
