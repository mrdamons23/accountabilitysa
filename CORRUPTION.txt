No problem. Here is the de-duplicated list of the corruption cases you provided:

**1. Allegations of Corruption Against Human Settlements Minister Thembi Simelane Related to Eskom Contracts**

**Summary:** Fresh corruption allegations surfaced in 2025 against Human Settlements Minister Thembi Simelane, stemming from her previous role as a project director at Vitrovian, a company contracted by Eskom. A News24 report claimed that during her tenure at Vitrovian, the company inflated prices for work conducted at the Kusile power station. This accusation follows prior scrutiny concerning a loan Minister Simelane received via a middleman linked to the collapsed VBS Mutual Bank. The Democratic Alliance (DA) stated that Simelane earned over R700,000 while working for Vitrovian, purportedly to suppress protests at the Kusile plant, and alleged that Vitrovian submitted outrageously inflated invoices to Eskom for work done by non-existent employees, with Simelane's signature on some invoices. Minister Simelane's spokesperson dismissed the claims. The DA announced its intention to lay criminal charges against Minister Simelane.
